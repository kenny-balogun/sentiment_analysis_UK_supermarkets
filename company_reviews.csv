0,Sainsburys,Roy Martin,GB,17 hours ago,"First rate buffet food A friend suggested we ordered buffet food from Sainsbury's, which we did and we were most satisfied. The staff member at Portswood Southampton branch was most helpful when we collected the food, which was well packaged. Once home we were inamazed at the quality, the filling in the sandwiches and the wraps was generous and of good quality. The salads were good, as were the cold meats The flans were excellent. Everyone had plenty to eat and went home with a well filled 'doggy bag'. Thanks Sainsbury's Date of experience: November 17, 2024",5

I don't buy everything there but I am a farily frequent visitor, particularly to get Nectar points converting to Avios. But I find their paper coupons very difficult to read especially on the back - extremely small type and orange print on white doesn't work for me in my 60s, and I would think the same for many much younger than me. At least print them in black please.Date of experience: November 14, 2024",4

The smartshop app of late is very slow to load and also in-between scanning for my products. This has now become very irritating and I'm now considering deleting this app unless there is an improvement. Also, when I'm at the still and checking-out after taking an eternity, it prompts to verify my purchases (most of the time now). Hence, Sainsbury's, despite being a loyal customer for years, appears not to trust me. Ok then....Date of experience: November 18, 2024",2

Check out expirience poor few tills and customers generally stressed very common.  Loss of staff served deli and cheese, meat counters missed. Loss of chemist in my branch.

14,Sainsburys,Nan,GB,14 hours agoInvited,"Disappointing My husband and I who are both in our eighties have done our main shopping every week in Sainsbury’s for many, many years. Unfortunately our experiences have become less enjoyable and harder work. Lately we have found that the shelves have not been dressed properly, viz the goods on the top and bottom shelves in particular are at the back of the shelf and impossible to reach and no sign of an assistant to help.Also  my husband picked up some fizzy drink with wrong price on the shelf (we use “scan and go”) He reported it and was told it would be corrected but the following week nothing had been done.Another thing which annoys me is when an item is advertised or is on offer and is out of stock.Also annoying is the way stock is moved around the store and often placed with unrelated random goods. This makes shopping harder.It would be helpful if your stores were age friendly and had seats where elderly customers could rest mid shop.Date of experience: November 14, 2024",3

The nectar offers are great, I can (almost) always get what I went for. They have a good selection of organics. I trust the quality. What I would like is less plastic!! Less packaging. Last time I went, the store had huge displays of lurid tacky plastic toys. Compare that to Lidl and Aldi's excellent wooden toy events.Unfortunately I barely ever buy their salads.  Washed leaves, squashed in a plastic bag, already going mushy. Again, compare with Lidl where I can buy lettuce in a plug of soil.

18,Sainsburys,Carys82,GB,2 days agoInvited,"A Clear Downgrading of Sainsbury's Local StoresAbsolutely appalled at the recent changes in stock and layout at the Sainsbury's Local nearest to me. Far more space is being given to junk: ready made pizza, crisps, biscuits, sweets and poor quality chocolate.Healthy items which I bought on a regular basis are no longer available and healthy food generally has been squashed into much smaller areas. Not everyone can afford to do food shopping online on a regular basis - I certainly can't. I rely heavily on my Sainsbury's Local and feel very let down.There is an obesity crisis in this country - not a problem - a crisis. Clearly Sainsbury's higher management couldn't care less about this and are putting their profits, bonuses and dividends for their shareholders above everything else. Utterly shameful.

28,Sainsburys,A.,GB,2 days ago,"Sainsbury’s; Inebriating the Nation & treating staff poorly My local Sainsbury’s: Williamson Road, London N4 is a big disappointment. It had a refurbishment, I went in last Friday; it’s become an alcohol warehouse. Alcohol has taken precedence over food or any other goods. Aisle after aisle in the centre of the supermarket. Instead of using the strap line ‘Feeding the Nation’, ‘Inebriating the Nation’ would be more accurate. My friend works there and says they made 2 staff redundant on the shop floor and gave everyone £1 an hour more. She said everyone wishes they would have kept their colleagues as they now have to work much harder for £1 an hour more.

My local (medium sized) store only allows for smartphone scanning (auto shop Wi-Fi login) and another local smaller store requires you to hunt around the store for a QR code to scan. Just provide gun technology in all please.

The shopping centre has been difficult to get to for several months due to ongoing roadworks.I did a smart shop as did my wife simultaneously.  When we scanned in our shopping at the checkout BOTH of us were selected for an item check. We were 8th and 9th in a queue to get an assistant to come carry out a check of 10 items! Then as my wife had a voucher another wait for an assistant to clear the voucher. It took longer to get through the payment process than it took to select our shopping. Then the gate scanner could not read the barcode on our receipts!!!!  Our total spend was well in excess of our normal delivered shopping as we both picked up extra items not on our list.

127,Sainsburys,Abdul ,GB,Updated 2 days ago,"""Do you think I want to do this on a Saturday night?"" Says the store manager (faulty gift card) - Romford Brewery Sainsbury's I bought a 3rd party gift card from Sainsbury's for £50 for my friend's birthday. The code on that gift card was invalid and despite many attempts to contact the issuer, I didn't have any success getting through to them on email or phone. I then went to Sainsbury's with the original receipt and the faulty gift card. I was then made to wait for 30 mins at the customer service desk and when the store manager (name starts with Rh) eventually turned up, she was not very empathetic at all to the situation I was facing. She kept insisting that Sainsbury's does not sell these gift cards completely ignoring the evidence I had presented her (original receipt) from Sainsbury's. I told her that anything sold in that store is the responsibility of Sainsbury's and as a customer who has been sold a faulty product it is their responsibility to address this. She kept ignoring me and said ""Do you think I want to do this on a Saturday night?"" and said she'd get sacked by Sainsbury's for refunding a £50 gift card.

I don't have the app or physical card. Every time I came i asked for help and typed the nectar card number. Today I asked for help and this women at the self checkouts didn't want to help me. I said I can type in the number and I need your help to do so. She kept telling me that I need to have my card and she was wrong as in I used my number, typed my number every time. She then went away and ignored me, when I needed her help to use a voucher as well. I never used a voucher before. I asked politely, can you please help me and she ignored me 3 times.

But at Sainsbury's they started something very strange with the reduced items. You have shopped and found some reduced items as well. Now you are doing the self scan but scanners will not scan the reduced items so you have to wait for the some member of the staff to put these reduced items through. It means you have to wait until someone is available. Which is so embarrassing and time wasting. Also staff start behaving really strange towards those customers who have a couple of reduced items in their shopping. Treat them like they have done something wrong. Make them to wait. Really embarrassing. I have decided I will only go to Sainsbury's if I really need to. Tesco is not far from my house. I think I will start shopping there. Why should I feel like this when I am paying for the items regardless they are full priced or reduced and who are they to behave that way towards the customers.

I rarely see them actually working with giggling with each other, very unprofessional for a upscale place such as Sainsbury's, you would think they were in a budget shop the way they act.

This isn’t because we prefer Tesco, we actually prefer Sainsburys. The reason we will travel 5 or 6 miles out of our way, instead of using the store half a mile away is because Sainsburys in Kidlington seems incapable of having the correct amount of stock. So often we have been in and they have no milk, bread, fruit or veg(just things like bananas and broccoli, nothing specialists), whole chickens and many other things. It is so frustrating to find they can’t get their stock levels correct on the most basic items. Because of this it is easier to go somewhere we know they will have it. It’s such a shame as it could be such a better store if just managed properly. I shop at Sainsburys in Wantage and Littlemore when I am in those areas as they are well stock. Also the one in Witney as it is such a lovely store. Real shame we seem to live next to the worst one in Oxfordshire. Date of experience: November 15, 2024",1

Again, the delivery drivers have been very good and sympathetic with the issue. I ordered the £12 meal deal. All items were available and order went through without any issue. Yet, on the day of delivery one item was not available which is quite understandable. What is sheer stupidity and lack of common sense is that the other 3 items are then supplied at their individual full price. So, for 4 items we would be charged £12 but instead we are charged £17( depending on the what was ordered) for 3 items. This has happened 3 times.

The weekly offers are tailored to my regular purchases, which makes it super straightforward too.Sometimes I struggle with items being discontinued or out of stock at my local branch, but the product selection and range of alternatives have improved over time, and I really like that they’re always adding new products to the shelves.My only real gripe is with the fruit.

The driver then demanded that I bring down the bags and expected that I would meet him downstairs to load my shopping bags from crates and then carry them from the block entrance to my flat.  Every other delivery driver had delivered to my flat front door using the block lift which this driver told me was my fault for not telling him that there was a lift.

Not only it is a massive waste of paper, we are also being treated like thieves who cannot be trusted to pay for their shopping.

Nowhere was it mentioned that I needed to take it to interview. She said she could not interview me without it. So I left with her wasting my time and effort.

Healthier, vegetarian or vegan products that I buy seem to be discontinued but there is certainly no shortage of snacks that are loaded with calories and alcohol. I am so frustrated by the endless conversations I have with staff when I am looking for products that I need.  Which brings me on to the annoying habit that staff have of swivelling around and charging off in the direction that the product should be while the customer has to try to keep up with them while pushing a heavy trolley.  To finish, I would say that Sainsburys staff do not seem to be happy.  They are usually somewhere between irritated and uninterested.

They use bags- I live on the first floor and have to transport my shopping upstairs. I have health issues so just unpacking all the shopping into bags takes me a long time. The drivers always standby and watch . If the shopping is in bags it can be just left in the hall for me to carry up at my pace. Incidentally the new supermarket drivers always ask me where I want my shopping without being asked and carry it up for me.2. The website makes online shopping difficult compared with 3 other supermarkets I have  used. For eg. If I want to view my selected items because I have found an better option of the same product, other supermarkets put my items into categories so it makes it so much easier whereas Sainsbury’s lists as selected. I have often ordered twice in error.3.

Apart from the absence of lamb stock cubes and lime and lemon jelly tablets for over a year, (eventually sourced on holiday in East Devon) they have stocked all I need.  We also miss the walnut bread and avocados recently were not all sound. The prices and quality rival Aldi and their plain salted crisps in bags of 12 and plain dark chocolate bars are excellent.

Nowhere on my order form were there any terms & conditions to this effect - neither were there any terms & conditions to Sainsburys acceptance of my order.

In addition to this the store is forever changing the location of items which can be infuriating when you just pop in quickly for a few things and you’re spending valuable time hunting down every day items that have simply changed isles which might work well for the store and the introduction of new lines however this won’t suite the elderly which simply hasn’t been considered. Add to this, many good selling lines have been taken off the shelves with no explanation as to when or if it will be restocked or been discontinued.

I have Sainsbury's website app installed on my mobile phone. It is intuitive, and very easy to use. Often I enjoy browsing the menu, but almost always I know what I want, and follow the order I had delivered previously, click on quantity I require this time, go to the ""booking a delivery"" section, pick a suitable date and time, pay with my debit card details, which are securely pre installed on the app. Done! As simple as that. Couldn't be easier. The delivery person is always super-friendly, and very helpful. He or she, bring the goods to my room, and place the items where I want them. I've shopped with Sainsbury's for several years, and never had a problem. Oh, one thing is forgot to mention, is, on the website, next to the items you pick, it says,  if the item is not available do you want them to pick an alternative. If not, tick a box.

Their conterfeit check machines at the tills would not accept the note. It was supplied direct to me by Lloyds Bank Aldershot Branch and was the last note of 21 supplied at that time. I suffered the embarassment of a queue people watching me apparently trying to tender a counterfeit note. This note was subsequently used for a successful purchase at Wickes.Dialogue with Sainsburys HQ resulted in a reponse that if their check machines would not pass their counterfeit protocols then their procedures meant non acceptance of the note. I was told at the tills to return the note to Lloyds !!!I believe that their counterfeit check software/hardware is out of date. No mention in the HQ response in what they actually intended to do to correct this issue nor any goodwill gesture for the embarassment they caused me.They are clueless about customer service, a small gesture would have gone someway to ease the embarassment.

They have no system for knowing which of the Smart shop devices are fully charged, invariably half way through shopping I have to find a staff member to replace the device because it’s run out of power ( could learn from Waitrose)!The toilets are a disgrace, ladies invariably have overflowing bins and paper all over the floor. My husband tells me the hand dryer in the Gents has been out of order for the last 6 weeks and last week they didn’t even have a blue paper roll for drying hands! No one to point this out to - customer service desk linked to Lottery Ticket sales and they would rather sell these than deal with customers.Shopped at Waitrose this week and will be doing so for the foreseeable future, they have helpful staff who know where items are kept.Date of experience: November 01, 2024",3

However, there were a LOT of things available in the supermarket. The very same supermarket my delivery came from..but were not available for me to have in my order for delivery. My biggest complaint is that when they haven't got what I ordered, they'd give me my refund in vouchers that I had to spend with them and not a refund to my bank account.I ordered 6 bottles of wine for 25% off. Two of my choice were not available, so they substituted those 2 with 2 that were not in the deal and then charged me full price for all 6. This resulted in them taking over £10 extra from my bank. When I complained they said they would issue a voucher for the £10 and not refund it to my bank account.This is just one example of many, many issues I had with Sainsbury's delivery.

Also, some of the salad items (particularly the ""salad bags"") had very short 'use by' dates - quite a lot for today. Over recent weeks the store has rearranged practically all its stock, which is hugely frustrating. I understand retailers' objectives, hoping to push different products into my trolley, but they should realise that I don't go shopping for enjoyment, I go to buy essentials and I would like to get round as quickly as possible, getting all the things on my list. I noticed that the Nectar discounts were fewer today, hence my bill was larger than normal. And, the number of ""manned"" tills has been reduced, but I will queue because I prefer to be served by a human being and I like to help people remain employed - and the floor staff are always friendly and helpful.

Quite a large & busy store but only ONE manned checkout open with SEVEN customers with trolleys queued up waiting. Quite normal here. I don't really like self service checkouts but on this occasion having only about 15 items gave it a go. One frozen item I had picked up came up at £7.50 instead of the £2.49 I had seen on the display. I asked the man supervising the self service if someone could put them back for me as I really didn't want to pay that much. He said something about 'no problem, our mistake have them on Sainsburys' which I though was very generous as he put them in the packing area. A female member of staff turned up just as I was finishing up & without a word helped herself to the item started scanning it & generally messing about with her 'phone etc. I admit after a few minutes I was huffing a bit & said that I simply wanted to pay for my shopping & get on. Said she was 'sorting out my problem' which as far as I was concerned had already been sorted & that she 'didn't like my attitude' I ended up paying the lower price for an item I'd already been told was gratis & had my attitude shot to pieces as an extra bonus.

711,Sainsburys,Wave Surfer,GB,"Nov 7, 2024","Sainsburys go-slow on self scanOver the past week or so, Sainsburys have modified their systems to prevent customers using the self scan machines for reduced items. Try it and you get a big red cross on the screen which needs an assistant to override.This is causing mayhem for the staff overseeing the self checkouts. I called at the St.Annes supermarket this evening and, of the six self scan tills in use, three had the red light flashing waiting for a staff member to enter the reduced item barcode whilst other customers were queuing to use the machines.  The assistant has to enter the original full price barcode before keying in the reduced price. My reduced price was on a bakery item and when the reduced label was pulled off from the paper, it made the original code unreadable. It took around five minutes of faffing to scan a couple of items which I could have done in a few seconds. The assistant was getting pretty fed up and rightly so. Who comes up with these bright ideas? Morrisons, Asda and Tesco seem to handle reduced items perfectly well with self scan. Date of experience: November 07, 2024",2

The shelves are rarely well stocked - even of basics - last weekend (Saturday lunch time) there were hardly any buns left other than burger buns (obviously no one wants them at this time of year as this was all that was left) Even basics such as carrots and parsnips were virtually empty - surely they didn't sell out?In addition since Sainsburys took off the dates from fresh fruit and veg, I think they also do not bother keeping stock correctly. I have always shopped on Saturdays for the week ahead and now I am finding veg and fruit doesn't even keep for 3 days, never mind the week, which it used to. An excuse to just leave old stock out is how it seems to me. Staff are rarely helpful and treat customers as an inconvenience, leaving trolleys blocking a lot of aisles and generally being miserable and unhelpful.I really wish a new supermarket would open near me, then Sainsburys wouldn't see me for dust.

742,Sainsburys,Tan,GB,"Nov 4, 2024","Discrimination at Sainsbury 760 Harrogate Road BD2Hi,I ( brunette, white female with blue eyes) was able to use all my pampers coupons a fortnight ago in one go (put through by the manager/ team leader in multiple transactions) but my sister in law who is blatantly a different race, religion and clearly looks like “trash” according to your deputy manager John because she had a baby in a carrier and her son holding her hand while she juggled a large trolly full of nappies and food. 😡 Why is there a different rule for me compared to my asian sister in law with a headscarf in the same store? Very Sad. John said there could only be one coupon used against one person. (Making up his own rules it’s only one coupon per transaction on the tills - check head office policies) She asked if she could use the coupon against one nappy put it in the car and then return back and do another transaction and do that a couple of times but was refused as John said he wouldn’t allow her back into the store and can only have one. How is someone with two young kids able to last on one nappy pack. Her 2 month old can’t wear the same size nappy as her 2 year old? She should be able to use the coupons pampers have sent her, after collecting points on the club app from the pampers nappies she has previously payed for in actual money from Sainsbury’s. Plus pampers give the money for coupons back to your company anyway.  The coupons say she can redeem as many as she likes at Sainsburys, Boots , Asda or Morrisons and has till June of next year. Why shall she pay when she has been sent coupons and why should she go to another store when she has only ever shopped at Sainsbury for god knows how many years. It only makes sense for her to pick up the nappies from the store she does her weekly shop from which is the Sainsbury on Harrogate road. It’s pissed a few family members and friends off and we will not be shopping at Sainsbury anymore. In the end she ended driving with her kids crying in the back to Asda Pudsey which took 30mins because of the busy traffic on Sunday before the shop closed. Kids crying in the back of the car isn’t a nice feeling when you’re new to having two under two is very hard and not very safe either. That moron JOHN and Sainsburys are a disgrace!

743,Sainsburys,Hanifa Begum,GB,"Nov 4, 2024","Horrible experience at Sainsbury…Horrible experience at Sainsbury Harrogate thanks to John, the deputy manager. I attended the store on Sunday with my 2 month old in a carrier and my 2 year old. My sister in law had given me her pamper vouchers that she has collected for several years as a loyal pampers club member along with myself. We have obtained between us a total of 5 vouchers. She has twins (9 months) and 3 year old and 5 year old. I wanted to redeem these along with doing my weekly shop  which I do at sainburys and have done for the last 5 years. I was refused service saying it can only be done at customer care desk and then was told once I got there that I can only use one coupon per transaction. Which I respected and feel is fair. However I did mention that can I go back into the queue and use the other vouchers as one pack of nappies of a particular size across 5 children doesn’t work. I was happy to carry out multiple transactions despite it being difficult with two young kids. But your incompetent deputy manager JOHN refused and said I won’t allow that! So frantically before the shops close on Sunday I was able to shop at ASDA and get my nappies, with the coupon, in the same transaction and for the two households was able to do the mid week food shop which came to just over £200 in Asda. Great experience at Asda pudsey. By they way our Wednesday food top up which usually is another £180 will be done at Asda now despite Sainsbury being 10 min from our house. Great Customer service goes a long way! My sister in law was able to pick up 4 Size 2 nappies last month from Sainsbury even when it was done in multiple transactions but in the same day and this was approved by the manager of the store “ Johns BOSS”. clearly john has an issue with people getting “free items”.  I’ll have you know we have collected thousands of pamper club points to get these vouchers and to be refused by this discriminatory prick is upsetting. As a company you have agreed with pampers to use these and pampers intern pay you back hence why your name is on the coupons. In future remove your names and I’ll spend my money elsewhere. Don’t misled people! We would have ended paying a fee towards the yellow nappies at your store today after the voucher and nectar points but we ended up in Asda and realised that even with our nectar benefits it’s actually cheaper at ASDA and we ended up getting a size 3 nappy pack free.

What disturbed me the most was I followed an elderly gentleman - with a walking aid out of the door & these 2 layabouts proceeded to ask him for money!

Your Smartshop APP has anomalies e.g. today it registered an item twice and did not notice until we got home.  We are using other retailers more & more as we are losing confidence in your self checkout system, you seem to be moving to a ZERO checkout aisle scenario this does not fill us and many people we know with confidence going forward.  After todays repeat experience we will no longer be using your SMARTAPP and will revert to one of your manned checkout aisles.

Today the elderly man before me had waited over 15mins and the previous week had been given totally the wrong order and had had to take it all back. Last time I used this I was not refunded for the items left behind so had to phone Customer Service.  I shall have to do so again today as only 5 of my 6 returned items have been refunded. There is a super lady, Dawn, who works at this branch and she is great and seems to be the only one who cares for the customer and does something about it. She had noticed us on the cctv and came out to help. She is excellent and you need more people like her. Often the heavy goods are packed on top of biscuits/bread - please just use common sense. The buzzer machine, which we used to ring to let the staff know we were there,  has not worked for a very long time - surely this could be fixed.

Also being given products that should not be on the shelf, I’ve had grapes that are brown and avocado’s that are so soft they are brown inside. It’s also quite frustrating when you order something that says it is in stock but then you find out the morning of your delivery they don’t have it, if I know it’s not in stock then I can order something else. Prices do seem to keep going up and up drastically. All the delivery drivers are nice and friendly and very helpful and on time.

No contact was received by me.  I have since been back to them and also completed a Contact form.  I cannot believe that they cannot solve this problem.

I followed them to tills and they walked straight through the large self serve till area without stopping hence goods not paid for.

I opted into Christmas bonus points where they quadruple the points instead they left me with minus 80% the club card points vouchers I collected from last year?, I did report that to them but honestly you would not expect that out of anyone.

What a massive disappointment at £8.95  plus £1.25 for a black pudding extra total £10.20. It arrived  quickly because it was probably pre cooked and on heat. Two “ plastic” fried eggs, three soggy hash browns, over done  baked beans, a plastic tasteless black pudding, two rashers of over done dry bacon,  two pieces of cardboard toast and two tasteless catering style cheap sausages. Frankly I was starving so I began to eat it whilst chatting to the wife,  then halfway through I realised I should have sent it back ! but carried on eating this rubbish food . What a complete let down and a never to be repeated experience. This is a great shop to shop in, just don’t eat there as it was atrocious and I had indigestion all day as a result. Come on Tesco your customers deserve better and I will lodge a formal complaint soon ,  so that other non suspecting customers get a better breakfast than this rubbish , that frankly wasn’t fit for your dog to eat .

During my visit this week I asked an assistant to check another colour of a product which they happily did.  I was told it was available but at bigger stores.  My issue is, if you need to do a 30 mile round trip, you really want to know the product you want is in that store so, you phone and on the phone you get told we don't do product enquiries.  Really not helpful Tesco.  Also, you have such an amazing range, get back online and let us order without having to do an hour-and-a-half trip (which of course could be for nothing as even if they are in store you may not have the appropriate size).

I telephoned your help line and the gentleman was very apologetic, and arranged for my order to be delivered again last night. The exact same thing happened, I again telephoned your helpline, and the two people I spoke to really did not care that they have left a disabled diabetic with chronic Kidney disease without any form of food or drink.

Originally I went to the Langdon hills superstore and I was told that I can't return clothes there and I should go to Pitsea or Mayflower Tesco. I decided to go to the mayflower Tesco with my partner as she used her apple pay to make the original purchase.When I went to the customer service desk, Sam was serving someone in front of me and she sounded very polite. When it was my turn to be served her whole demeanor changed when I told her that I would like a refund/exchange. Sam told me that they don't do exchanges because the till won't allow her to do so, but she can do a refund. I said I will go and get my partner as she has the phone that she paid with through apple pay. Sam told me that I can't have a refund because I don't have the physical card with me, another person came over saying that I can't have a refund or exchange and can I move aside. I found both of them to be very rude and I felt I was treated differently to the person before me in the queue. They both folded up the hoodie and handed it back to me. I asked the second person her name as she wasn't wearing a name badge, she said her name is Amy.I was about to leave when I saw Gary who was one of the till managers, he was friendly and listed to the issue I was having with his staff members. He confirmed that Sam and Amy were wrong and a refund can be issued. I left the store and waited in the car while my partner saw Amy for the refund. I can definitely say this was the worst level of customer service I've received for a long time and I'd say there are many more friendly customer focused staff members inside the store that should be on the customer service desk instead of Amy and Sam.Date of experience: November 13, 2024",1

I used to have delivery to fit around my previous job so I thought I'd give it a go again, because I know the shopping comes from a different store. Received a few deliveries, the drivers were miserable, while I received everything I ordered the fresh products were as bad as my local store. So I've just gone to cancel my Tesco delivery plan and it seems they don't allow 'any time' cancellation any more!! Why?? I know it was probably detailed in the terms I agreed to, but I've had delivery saver several times over the years and have always loved how easy it was to set up and cancel when no longer required, and naturally didn't expect such a change - I seriously doubt customers have remarked on customer surveys that one thing they wished Tesco would do better is to ""make the Delivery Saver a fixed-term contract"". Given my grievances with the quality of the products they sell, and the quality of the staff they employ lately, I've come to the conclusion that Tesco really don't care about customers like they claim to, just profit, like everywhere else I suppose.

Said I wouldn't do it again as just over a month ago was called up for random bag check.  Stood there embarrassed as they rescanned half my shopping.  Got randomly selected today 17 items had to be rescanned.  This hardly makes customers feel valued.  I shop at Morrisons, M&S Lidl, Sainsburys, and have never had to have my shopping checked.  I asked how many thieves they catch doing this answer was 7 or 8.

On 21st October 24 around 20:45 I visited the Workington store to purchase 6 bottles of my favourite wine which was on offer. There was only 1 bottle on the shelf. On an adjacent aisle, one of the members of staff, Jackie Cowan was replenishing stock on the shelves. I asked her if she could do a stock check on the wine for me. Without hesitation, she stopped what she was doing and came with me to look at the wine that I wanted. Upon checking her PDA she told me that there were 6 bottles in stock in the store. She went into the stockroom to get these but returned a short time later to inform me that there was no stock even though 6 bottles were showing. She told me that the Whitehaven store had 20 bottles and given it was late, I told her that I would go early the following morning for some. She then told me that her son was working at Whitehaven the following day and that she would ask him to put 6 bottles aside for me. She then went a step further and contacted the Whitehaven store and ensured that 6 bottles were left with Customer Services.Jackie deserves recognition from her employers. Service like this is rare and is what promotes customer loyalty. I hope to read that she has been congratulated and rewarded for helping me get the wine that I love.

155,Tesco,Pennycute,GB,"Nov 5, 2024","Elderly man humiliated in Tesco Litherland by staffTesco Litherland is where I do all of my shopping and myself and my son where horrified by a supervisor and what she did to an elderly gentleman on Saturday 02/11/2024 at 10:03 Store: 5801 Checkout: 025. The elderly gentleman produced £60.00 in £1.00 coins. The lady on the till said she needed to check if she could take £1.00 coins for this amount, so called her supervisor. The supervisor said no we can not take £60.00 in £1.00 coins, the till can't cope with this. She said she would have to shut the till down. Now there wasn't a queue and my son and I would happily have gone to another till, however the supervisor made a big deal of this customer being inconvenient and refused to take his money and he had to leave his groceries. The guy was mortified and my son who normally doesn't say anything, asked the supervisor, why are you doing this, why are you humiliating this man? I am more verbal and asked why is Tesco a multi billion £ company unable to accommodate £60.00 in £1.00 coins? Because we spoke out, the guy went from looking ashamed to smiling - unfortunately the shopping he spent a lot of time selecting he could not have, because the supervisor with cold indifference, dismissed him, just like that. The feeling I got was this must be Tesco's policy, she was so blaza and didn't care. I took early retirement after 34yrs working for the Civil Service, in supervisory and management roles, but I would never treat anyone like that. Supervisors are paid to think outside the box and I'm guessing in retail to do everything possible to keep customers coming back (never mind the moral issue). In the Litherland store there is a money exchange booth, it would not have taken much to change the coins there, if the tills can't cope - although I can not understand how in this day and age of technology the till couldn't cope, a man was humiliated and a supervisor couldn't care less - come on Tesco??

158,Tesco,bananabongo,GB,5 days ago,"I'd give zero stars if I couldI'd give zero stars if I could. I have serious health conditions (1 heart related) after a virus 10 years ago. Not my fault. This is why I mostly get my food shop delivered.  I was in A&E just 2 days ago. I'm supposed to be avoiding any stress.I wrote on the delivery note to ask that they please leave the shopping in the boxes I provide (which are in my conservatory). I state that this is for health reasons. There is a very small box to explain. I've re-worded it several times hoping the driver might understand. Today (as several times previously) the driver has clearly not read the note. I used to politely explain. But was shown no understanding, instead the driver moodlily throws the shopping in the boxes. I've had crushed bread under cans, broken eggs, open yogurts all over my shopping. It is enough hard work for me to put it away without having to clean up or have to explain repeatedly to Tesco.Since the distress this has caused me before, my husband has gone to the door because I can't face them anymore. I actually feel stressed now when I know the shopping is coming.My husband works from home. He wears a headset and cannot leave his desk to bring shopping in. He is monitored, cannot pre-book a lunch time to do it, does various changing shifts. No flexibility allowed.With my ill health I cannot work & we cannot afford for my husband to lose his job.We also SERIOUSLY need to avoid catching any viruses / infections hence not wanting to get too close to others. My immunity is low. So we don't want to be stood inside with a Tesco driver arguing with either of us.Today's driver really tried to argue the point. My husband did not lose his temper & went back to his desk. I could hear the delivery man throwing my shopping in the boxes in a mood. This was going on whilst I was having heart palpitations. I called Tesco after I'd tried to relax a bit... & explained what happened. There were no signs that the person was listening to me. He was silent & did not once say ""I see, ok"" or anything like that. I asked if he was still there because he was so silent I thought we'd been disconnected. When I'd finished relaying what had happened (just like the other times). He did say that he was sorry. But that's easy to say, because he then proceeded to say something along the lines of: the driver isn't obliged to leave the shopping, we need to make sure someone is there for it. I'd literally just explained that my husband went to the door & showed him the boxes? He'd signed for it. So I wonder what the customer service man was doing when I was speaking.The customer service rep then says he'll contact my local store. I remembered how my local store manager called me before & said she'd make sure to call me weekly to ensure I don't get the same driver. I thought how fantastic that was. I never heard from her again. I'm too trusting clearly.I've heard it all before. I even said thank you but I'm going to go elsewhere & goodbye... before I hung up. I must be mad being so polite to people who don't care.Don't get ill! Many people treat you like rubbish & that is the last thing ill people need. You can be previously healthy & live a healthy lifestyle & be struck down with a virus, infection, an accident and it can change your life for the worst regardless of anything you do to try to avoid it! You'll see how the world lacks empathy. What I really needed was just some practical help. Some of the drivers have been wonderfully understanding and packed the shopping beautifully. I so absolutely appreciate those people. But unfortunately I need my shopping to not be damaged ever unless it is due to forgivable, natural human error rather than my shopping being thrown down in a strop.Today was the probably at least the 10th time myself & my husband experienced a rude delivery driver who damaged our shopping. This was the 4th time I have phoned up to complain. I never left a review before because I trusted they would rectify the problem. In fact, I even contacted Tesco and thanked them after a few nice delivery drivers had delivered my shopping.Whilst the telephone customer service staff say words of apology & offer solutions to change the situation, nothing changes. It is just words. I am now forced to go elsewhere. I've been a Tesco customer all my life & my mother was. I'm now going to cancel further shops including Christmas. It isn't like I haven't tried.How absolutely dissapointing. I expect they are just relieved to get rid of inconvenient ill people who are forced to rely on others for a bit of practical help occasionally. They've no idea how hard it is for a previously independent person to have to ask for help, let alone have to practically beg.Shame on you. Date of experience: November 14, 2024",1

They do what they want. Discontinue items I buy regularly. The shelves are often missing items they can’t stock properly.  I go in 7 days a week to buy a meal deal with costa coffee (machine) and at least 2 days a week the machine doesn’t work. And at least 4 days a week something missing.  Be it the right size cup. Or sweeteners. Or stirrers. Or the machine is filthy.     The petrol station NEVER sticks enough to complete a meal deal.   Complain to customer services they call on tannoy and no one. comes.  Ignored. I end up walking out. Frustrated and fed up. It’s massively out of my way to go to other supermarkets.  And these giant supermarkets have destroyed all the small shops.So I have to go without, I used to fully shop in Tesco. But now I don’t recognise the company at all. I get better food, better prices.  Better rewards in Icelands/food warehouse.I walked past a group of staff who were discussing how much they wanted the whole group of asylum seekers to drown in the French crossing rather than they few that did!!  Rather than helping customers. They regularly prioritise their chats and personal phones over helping customers. I haven’t walked into Tesco with a list. And come out with all I needed since before the pandemic. I ALWAYS have to go elsewhere. I point blank refuse to do online shopping as that’s horrendous. I gave up. Completely gave up. I get almost as many substitutes than items I receive. I tried asking for managers and you get fobbed off or they refuse to come at all. Date of experience: October 21, 2024",1

I have shopped consistently at Tesco every week, demonstrating unwavering loyalty. Yet, my experience at the Tredegar St Cardiff store on Sunday, the 20th, at around 10:15 am has left me furious and completely disappointed.When I arrived, the external sensor on the door was not working properly, as it often has not of late. Several customers and a staff member, who was smoking far too close to the entrance, stood outside, waiting for someone inside to trigger the sensor. When I gestured to a staff member standing behind the glass to open the door, I was met with a dismissive shrug—clearly, he had no interest in helping.After another customer triggered the door, I went in, grabbed my items, and headed to checkout. The same staff member who dismissed me earlier was glaring and saying something from behind the security screen. When I politely asked him to simply trigger the sensor earlier, he retorted, “That is not my job.” I reminded him that helping customers should be part of his job, but he defensively claimed he was busy, which was clearly not true.What happened next escalated quickly. This member of staff, a 6’4” thug of a man, started raising his voice at me despite being several yards away and behind a thick glass screen. He seemed determined to cause a scene. At this point, he called another staff member over, a lady I had interacted with before. I apologised to her for being called over unnecessarily and explained the situation. She told the aggressive staff member to stop, but he blatantly ignored her and continued his aggressive behavior.I finished my transaction, ignoring his outburst, but I am appalled at the lack of professionalism and outright aggression from this individual. The shift manager did absolutely nothing to deescalate the situation, showing complete indifference. The staff member in question not only disregarded his duty shift manager’s instructions to shut up but continued to throw his weight around, showing no respect for either the staff or the customers.Afterwards, when I contacted customer services, they informed me that they wouldn’t even report the incident to the store management team. This just reinforces my belief that Tesco simply does not care about their customers. Despite my 35+ years of loyalty, they have demonstrated they are not interested in addressing such appalling behaviour.Once I spend my remaining Clubcard vouchers, I will never set foot in a Tesco store again. They have lost my loyalty entirely, and their apparent disinterest in customer care is inexcusable. I strongly urge management to address the thug behavior and lack of professionalism displayed by their staff before they lose more loyal customers.Date of experience: October 20, 2024",1

He said 10-11 then corrected himself to 11.06 to 11.31.I asked him what he was supposed to do if he was early. He didn’t answer.I told him he was supposed to call and then asked him why he didn’t.He then said “Sorry, but …” and offered to take all the shopping back.I said I would take the delivery but I was explaining why I was p***ed off because I was just about to have a shower.I took the shopping inside and handed the returns to the driver.He then said “Can I just say, I was supposed to be on 8-12 today.” Accused me of swearing at him, which I clearly didn't. He was pointing his finger at me, stepping towards me on my doorstep. He then said he was going to complain to the store and would not deliver my shopping again. Not sure what the process is for staff complaining about customers when they were wrong and then when called out they get aggressive.  Clearly Tesco have one, so that's an interesting step in customer care.All this when it was pretty clear that he wanted to go home early, which is why he didn’t do what he was supposed to.This is not the first time it happens. It happens frequently and that’s not counting the times when they are ‘just five or ten minutes early’.Called their customer service line. They spoke to the store and no-one was available to speak with me. Told them that I couldn’t believe that no-one was in charge of the store and asked a duty manager to call me. Was promised a call the same day.After no call at 4pm I called again. Explained the situation and was told someone would call me within 5 minutes.Half an hour later, still no call.In the last year I have spent £13,506.14 in Tesco.Have seen that Tesco don’t respond to negative reviews here. Apparently, they don’t respond when their staff are rude and threatening to customers either. Then again, after my experience, they're probably speechless too.There is now absolutely nothing that will make me continue doing my weekly shopping with Tesco. They clearly don’t value it.Date of experience: October 13, 2024",1

224,Tesco,Paul,GB,"Oct 15, 2024","Flawed Logic in Self-Scan Devices & and Poor Attitudes from StaffIncreasingly in the past year or so, I have encountered issues with the handheld self-scan devices, whereby either a handheld device remains locked in its docking station upon pick-up, or the handheld has trouble scanning some barcodes during the shop - forcing several attempts on the same item and/or being forced to select another off the shelf to scan instead. The trouble with these unprovoked anomalies is that they often result in a check, either partial or (worst case) full, at checkout.Yesterday, at the Mold store in Flintshire, upon scanning my Clubcard to collect a scanner the screen instructed me to speak with a member of staff. It transpired that the ""system"" believed I had not returned the scanner used in my shop last week, and had consequently locked my Clubcard to prevent me from walking away with another! Ironically, the week prior, I was engaged in conversation with one of the shift managers at the point of scanning my completed shop and she witnessed me return the ""missing"" handheld scanner. Obvious flaw here:If Tesco instructs customers to deposit the handheld in a publicly accessible area once checkout is complete, at that point Tesco has to accept, by definition, that the customer relinquishes all responsibility for that device, from that moment onwards. It is inconceivable to me that a system could be set-up (and rolled-out across the nation, it would seem) with such flawed logic, that a million and one things could happen to that device after the customer has innocently deposited it in the rack, as instructed, and yet that same last user is then held accountable (according to the system) for it's safe return to a docking station. That is clearly what the on screen message indicated to me yesterday when I tried to collect a handheld and it is wholly wrong! At the completion of yesterday's shop, not surprisingly, a full-check was triggered at check-out. In this particular case I half expected it and so went about making light of the situation with the staff. So far that morning though, THROUGH ABSOLUTELY NO FAULT OF MY OWN, I'd had my Clubcard frozen on (false) suspicion that I previously stole a scanner, was instructed as such on the screen for anyone to read, and had now been subjected to a full-check as a consequence.The young lady who performed the full check missed two items - meaning she did not scan two items which I had – meaning, effectively, that I now stood accused of gifting money to Tesco by scanning items to pay for and leaving them on the shelf! I promptly pointed out the two items she'd missed but sadly not before a manager had witnessed the young lady simply stating ""there are two items missing"", immediately implicating me as someone who has tried to take items without paying. The young lady quickly scanned in the two ""missing"" items and I deposited my concern (calmly) that this might trigger another full check next week. I was met with the following from the young lady: ""It's done now and I don't want to talk about it anymore"", before she simply walked away.In summary:- Tesco's handheld system has a completely flawed built-in logic, which effectively holds the last using customer responsible for its safe return to the dock, in spite of on screen instructions to deposit that handheld in a publicly accessible wooden rack next to the check-out after paying.- Tesco's flawed system holds customers to account, via full checks, for any and all system anomalies encountered with the handheld device, from failed attempts to retrieve locked-in devices upon collection, to failed attempts to scan barcodes during a shop- Tesco's staff appear to be empowered to determine their own personal limits in customer interactions, and impose them sharply and without consequence, as and when it takes their fancy.I hope customers will read this and make up their own minds before rushing to use those handhelds at Tesco, or indeed shop there at all. But for Tesco: really, this is not a set of attitudes you should be proud of displaying, neither through your systems nor your staff.Date of experience: October 14, 2024",1

They do use a very vague language to say something about different pricing that is definitely not clear at all. If you do choose whoosh, then as you check out your bill will be massively, seriously increased - something the shopper should have been clearly and transparently warned BEFORE choosing whoosh.

I placed my order for delivery on Wednesday 2nd October 2024 between 10pm and 11pm. I waited for my order but it did not arrive nor did I receive any message to let me know that it had been cancelled. I waited until midnight and called customer service. But they close at 11.00pm and I was not able to call until the morning.I called in the morning and I was told that my order had been cancelled because the delivery person was unable to deliver my grocery order and two others by 11pm. I asked if this was normal and she said yes.But then made it clear, it is not normal in the term that this is meant to happen.She then said she will speak to the correct department to see if my order can be delivered on that day and I should hear back by twelve noon.After 2pm, I received an email from Tesco saying that my order had been cancelled. They sent me a link as an option to reorder and they said my account has been refunded which I will receive in the next 3 to 5 days. Therefore, I have no food and no money to purchase more food. Plus the time I took to order and wait around was not taken into consideration and none of this was even my fault.I have been shopping with Tesco's for over twenty years. There has been some issues but, I am now shocked at the very poor standards that I have received with this order. I have had a similar experience with Tesco previously, when I placed an order. The delivery person came an hour early. As I was not home, they cancelled my order. That was not my fault as I booked a specific time and always get home well before that time. But not an hour early. I get a sense that Tesco are not bothered about how their customers feel and therefore continue to do the same. All their responses so far were as if all this is normal service. I recall speaking to a Tesco delivery person after waiting a while for my delivery which was becoming common practice. The delivery person said Tesco are taking on more than they can handle. This is becoming clearer as it impacting on their customers. I find this extremely unacceptable and I am highly disappointed. Why would I place another order to only be treated the same way. Especially as there was no acceptance of any wrong doing. I trusted Tescos which is the reason why I shopped with them. I have completely lost my trust and faith in them.

For my last three shoppings, I was selected to scan my whole shopping again.The last three shoppings at Addlestone were:14 Sep 2024: £165.86  (full scan again)26 Sep 2024: £242.03  (around 50 items scanned again - Tesco staff named 'Ranu')TODAY 1 Oct 2024: £66.14  (full scan again - Tesco staff named 'Ranu')Initially I thought, it may have been because I did a big shopping on the 14th Sep - the store manager was nevertheless kind enough to let two employees do the scan again in a till. Then, for the second one, I thought it was bad luck, however you may wonder, what are the chances I’m selected again TODAY, three times in a row, for a £66+ shopping?I spoke today with Tesco staff at Addlestone (Mr Raff and Ms Ranu). Actually Ranu remembered me because she was the one re-scanning the 50+ items last Thursday.Both of them agreed that it seems not very ‘random’ that I keep being selected for a full scan three times in a row.I will most likely return to Tesco Addlestone next week, and I already mentioned to Mr Raff and Ms Ranu that I will contact them, as well as the store manager, if I am ‘randomly’ selected for a full scan a fourth time in a row.Can you please check that you don’t have a bug in your system that makes me re-scan everything again every single time, or otherwise if you decided to add me into a re-scan list of some sort for some inexplicable reason, let me know so I can use the till instead and don’t waste my time.RegardsDate of experience: October 01, 2024",1

310,Tesco,Danny,GB,"Sep 28, 2024","It’s with deep disappointment that I…It’s with deep disappointment that I write this review, shedding light on Tesco’s appalling treatment of its staff—treatment that paints a stark contrast to the glossy, customer-friendly image they like to project. Behind the corporate façade lies a company that not only condones but seems to foster a toxic culture of bullying, mental health stigmatization, and management abuse.The heart of any organization is its people, but at Tesco, that heart is left to wither under the constant barrage of belittlement and bullying. It’s disgraceful that this global retail giant allows management to undermine and degrade their employees in the most insidious ways. Staff are treated as though they’re disposable, spoken to with condescension and disrespect, and often pressured into excessive workloads with no regard for their well-being. Instead of empowering and supporting their team, Tesco allows managers to rule with an iron fist, with little to no oversight or consequence for abusive behaviour. The corporate culture here promotes fear rather than motivation.In a time where mental health awareness is at its peak, Tesco seems to be living in the dark ages. Not only is there an utter lack of support for employees struggling with mental health issues, but it goes beyond neglect—Tesco management actually mocks and ridicules those who seek help. Mental health is a serious issue that affects millions, but here, it’s used as a punchline or, worse, a reason to belittle someone. This is beyond unacceptable; it’s morally bankrupt. To allow such treatment in any workplace is outrageous, but from a company as large as Tesco, it’s utterly indefensible.It’s clear that Tesco’s HR processes are little more than window dressing. Complaints are routinely ignored, and those who speak up about mistreatment often find themselves the target of even worse harassment. It’s a sickening pattern: staff members who rightfully seek help are brushed off or told to “toughen up,” while the bullies in management are protected and even promoted. This behaviour is more than just negligence—it’s actively harmful. Instead of addressing issues, Tesco allows these managers to run unchecked, creating an environment where bullying is not just tolerated but encouraged.Higher management’s behavior is the cherry on top of Tesco’s toxic workplace culture. It’s one thing for supervisors to overstep their bounds, but for senior management to bully, ridicule, and tear down staff is outrageous. It sets the tone that this kind of abuse is acceptable—and it’s not. Senior leaders should be setting an example of respect, professionalism, and care, but at Tesco, they seem to revel in their power, using it to intimidate and humiliate those beneath them. It’s a disgusting display of what happens when a company allows unchecked power dynamics to spiral out of control.Date of experience: September 28, 2024",1

To be shouted at by staff who told me you can only have a basket we are closing at 10pm. Well I find it difficult to carry a basket. I have severe back problems. There was nothing to give a reason for closing early, and no explanation.When I went to leave the shop the security garden was letting people out but would only open the door a little bit not fully. I did not enjoy squeezing through a small gap.This store never improves. When you walk into the store you have to walk through a cloud of cigarette smoke or cannabis. You have people constantly begging for money. I have observed on several occasions security staff enjoying long conversations. It's really off putting being constantly approached and asked for money. A lot of the staff are rude and really can't be bothered. Quite often at the tills they don't even look at you when they are serving you are asking for payment. This is not good customer service it's utterly rude. I have lived in many places in the UK andthis is the worst Tesco I have ever been in. Nobody seems to have any manners or actual care about the customers. Are management actual blind! I would rather travel 10 miles to shop than shop here which is five minutes away.

As immediate impacts, I could not walk more than a few steps, and could not stand for long either. Tesco’s response: “you’re in the way and if you don’t shift I’ll get security to shift you.” This was repeated (with varieties) a number of times despite me explaining I was injured, and I was refused assistance by other staff too.Since being discharged from hospital a couple of months later, minus legs, I have been pursuing a complaint with Tesco regarding their staff attitude and behaviour towards customers when in medical need. They repeatedly refuse to even acknowledge receiving a complaint and definitely refuse to apologise. When I spoke to their Head Office, I was told this is company policy with all complaints regarding staff behaviour, so even if their staff punch you in the face, don’t expect an apology from the company, or for them to even accept that the incident happened.

Where most companies I would have assumed would make improvements- Tesco have lost their way. Major issues aren’t rectified which makes it difficult for people to shop and place their trust in them. Major issues using Tesco delivery saver app. I’ve alerted them before but nothings changed for the better.     When placing my order, all the products are the basket successfully. My order is complete. However if items go out of stock for your delivery- they don’t alert you! Even on the receipt. TESCO are literally gaslighting their customers (which is illegal) by removing items we know we order and aren’t told TESCO have removed them. It has caused unnecessary confusion. They are messing with customers minds.I’m sick of the confusion with every delivery! It’s not difficult to indicate a product is out of stock and what the product is that’s missing.   Further messy confusion is now (rather than improving their app ) they have sabotaged it further by turning it into eBay! I type in BBQ sauce it gives a host of BBQ tools and stuff for the garden that aren’t even sold by Tesco! What is that about? We use you for food and some household items available inside your stores. I’ve worked in retails for many years and it honestly looks like someone’s sabotaging it from the inside. Nothings improved and it’s getting worse to shop at Tesco. 20 years of home delivery and it’s now wasting customers time to shop via the app.  Their list of items to arrive with your shop is now scrawling pointless items you don’t type in. Not disabled or family friendly to use. Time to step away. TESCO don’t seem to know what they want to be.   My husband and I have ended up switching to Amazon to purchase household items like toilet cleaners as they aren’t in the search engine. A major overhaul is needed. Management need to fix what’s already broken without confusing loyal customers. I’ve now got household items on repeat order from Amazon due to Tesco not offering basic items.

I ordered a scrubbing brush with my usual weekly grocery shop not realising that the order would be treated completely separately from my grocery shop. During the order process Tesco did not give any guidance on the process or provide any process by which to cancel the order.  I called Tesco when I realised they were passing my order onto a third party.  A rather unhelpful customer service manager told me that I could not cancel the order and should contact the market place seller.  He said that I must take delivery and then return the item.  I tried to raise a formal complaint but was told that the matter would be escalated but there was no guarantee that anyone would come back to me about my complaint.  The manager then cut me off.  I contacted the third party seller called Rinkit and got a recorded message saying ""announcement there is no one available to  take your call - goodbye"".  No information about opening hours or how to get in touch.   No contact details for the third party seller on the order.  This is is very poor practice and I am shocked that Tesco think this is even acceptable.  I told them I would go to the the financial conduct authority or similar and the manager refused to provide a written response to my complaint.  I later found out I could cancel the order within 30 minutes of making it.  How would I know this if Tesco fail to provide the information.Tesco, have also carefully put procedures in place to ensure that they are accountable to no one.  You can't complain in writing.  I tried and got an automatic response saying they will not reply.

All they would say is you need to pay £125 now or we will take you to court, threatening CCJs and threatenting to affect my ability to get a mortgage.

And they just refunded me the £1.30 plus a bit more, after all my time wasted.  They should have a standard and quite large compensation policy for instances where they overcharge like this.

I had misplaced four A4 sheets of paper that contained crucial preparation materials for a job interview I had the next day. To many, it might seem like just a few sheets of paper, but to me, it was invaluable, and without them, I would have struggled to prepare adequately for my interview.Initially, the security department introduced me to Matt, a member of the team, who assisted me by searching the store. Unfortunately, we couldn't find the documents. At this point, I felt quite disheartened, but Matt refused to give up. He called in the store manager, Connor, who took the time to listen patiently and understand my situation. Upon learning that I still had the documents in my email, he immediately took me to Tyresse, who kindly helped me print out the papers on the spot.Their kindness and willingness to help me, even when the issue may have seemed small, left a lasting impact on me. While I’ve sometimes had reservations about the service at this location, this experience proved to me that there are employees who truly care about their customers and go out of their way to make a difference.Thank you, Matt, Connor, and Tyresse – your efforts are truly appreciated, and regardless of how my interview goes, I’ll always remember this act of kindness.Date of experience: September 09, 2024",5

Narrow aisles cluttered with discarded cardboard and product trollies, internet shoppers abandoning trollies, internet shoppers stopping to natter to their colleagues oblivious to shoppers trying to get by. When you finally reach the product shelf you are after you find it empty. All this combined with surly and blasé staff gives you the opinion you are barely tolerated in their store.

After recently moving into a new home, I found myself without key grocery items including food for the dog. I didn't want to leave the dog to go shopping as we are not fully settled in our new home yet and so I needed a prompt delivery option. There was a choice between Tesco and another 3 major retailers but only Tesco had all of the items needed in stock and at roughly the right price online. The £2.99 delivery fee is a bit steep but well worth it. I was allowed 30 minutes to place the order and it promised delivery within 25 minutes once the order was placed. Well, as soon as I hit the payment button, I received a text from Uber, their partner in our area I presume, and within 8 minutes my order had arrived. The delivery guy was smiling and greeted me happily, lovely customer service! ❣️ The produce was securely fastened inside a strong Tesco ""Woosh."" paper bag and, I hate to say it, but Tesco could teach the Co-op (sorry Co-op) a thing or two about packing shopping for delivery because it was perfectly achieved with items that could be slotted, slotted, heavy on the bottom, bread on top and in perfect condition upon arrival. It sounds so simple, but not many other retailers get this right. Every item purchased was present and in good condition, fab. 👍To finish, some Clubcard points for the husband's balance so a win win all round. I will definitely consider using Tesco ""Woosh."" again, good job Tesco! (and the lovely courier on the moped). 😀Date of experience: September 04, 2024",5

Theres no signage at car drivers eye level that is easily seen on approach, especially at 4pm when the sun is shining brighht and the sun visors are down. You have the signs about 10 -12 feet high up in the air immediately before the bay in very small letters. When the sun is out the sign is not visible, especially as it's almost like a sun reflector because it is askewed and just not visible.There are no driver eyeline warnings. Nor are there any pedestrian eyeline warnings of being fined. And finally, there is not roadside or in lane lines showing such restrictions, no red or yellow lines. Once parked and rushing to the cashpoint, the sign is facing the opposite direction because it is before the pull in bay - or what used to be a pull in bay, and you cant see it on the way back either.When did you change these rules, and why isn't there clear signs for this bay. There are signs about parking properly and signs about not parking in the doctors bays that are literally infront of the bay at the driver eyeline and at eye level when getting out of the car so that it is not easily missed.But this sign edges on the illegal if not immoral.I for one will not be shopping at this Tesco's anymore and when my delivery saver runs out, that's it, end of loyalty. You've just cost me £100 and I'm sending the photos to BBC RIP OFF BRITAIN, and moving to ASDA Deliveries from now on.The sign looks like it's been purposely put there to rip off locals who used to be able to park there to get cash out of the ATM that you invite your customers to use - not any more!!!An absolute disgrace  I will be posting publically everywhere I can.Date of experience: August 24, 2024",1

I ordered an item through Tesco Marketplace from Hirix who did not deliver the item and will not refund the money.  Hirix review show they do this 50% of the time.   It is nearly 2 months and there may be a 60 time limit on getting my refund?   although I have been trying since week 3. Tesco will not honour my payment and refund it to me, Hirix is fraudulent and do this consistently and get away with it.   There seems to be no way I can get this money repaid if Tesco is taking the actual payment directly but if Hirix took the money directly my bank would refund for this fraud.   Beware Tesco market place and also Tesco's bad policy to push their market place onto the general public,  take our money and take no responsibility for vetting fraudulent companies. If this money is not repaid I will never use Tesco again,  I believe we should use companies we trust and want to support and I no longer want to give Tesco any of my money.After 2 months Tesco and hirix have confirmed I will be refunded but this has taken 10 emails,  3 calls to hirix and an online form and 4 calls to Tesco plus a formal complaint letter to head office. I did not realise that there is no actual legal support for non delivery and non refund for online shopping ??? Maybe the small claims tribunal which you need to pay for ??

My elderly parents both have dementia and can't get out, so we organise weekly Tesco deliveries for them. Last week, my dad phoned to say that the usual delivery hadn't arrived. I asked him if he was sure, as Tesco are normally very reliable, and the website indicated that the delivery had been made, but he was adamant. So I contacted Tesco, who immediately refunded the cost of all the shopping (£122) and rearranged the delivery in the first available slot. It was only when my sister went to visit my parents yesterday that she found duplicates of all the groceries, which means that the original order had indeed been delivered (although my dad continues to swear it wasn't). I immediately phoned Tesco to apologise and pay for the duplicate order, but the lovely girl was very understanding and said they had no way of taking a payment like that, so not to worry ... which means that Mum and Dad got £122 worth of groceries for nothing!

Also all over the kitchen floor. Spent around 1/2 hour washing all the fridge items and cleaning the floor. Driver said that is funny your are the third person today the milk has burst on. He did refund the milk. I asked if he would get his store manager to phone me. I then phoned the Tesco call centre and after a bit they did agree to give me a credit for twenty pounds for all my trouble. I still asked if I could get a call back from the store manager because the main problem is the driver's throw all the items into the same crate to reduce the number of crates they bring to the house and causing damage. This is not the first time milk has been burst. I phoned back on Saturday evening to the call centre. Not have received a call back from the store. They said all they could do was to ask the store again and maybe since it was the weekend nobody was available at the store. Phoned back again on Monday evening to be told the store had not received the pervious two requests to phone me. The call centre said they had done it this time and the store would call me back soon. I said I was not happy with the situation and wanted to speak to a manager at the call centre. About 1 hour later I got a call back from the call centre. The manager more or less said the store is not interested in calling me and since he dealt with all complaints that was the end of the matter. Still waiting for the store to phone me.

I forgot to buy water so I picked up water and went to self checkout again.  The employee actually assisted me as the water total came up for two but I had only scanned one!  So he knew I had paid previously and then gone back to get the water.  As I left the store the bag with my main shopping beeped once and the same employee came up to me and said have you paid for your shopping!!!  He saw me pay!  I said yes and then I had to show proof I had paid.  I go into that branch of Tesco’s probably 4 times a week - he knows me - yet I had to go on my internet banking to prove I had paid.  The internet was poor so it took me a few moments to get on my banking and whilst doing this he said - of if you can’t get on your banking, I can check on the machine.  I showed him the proof on my phone.  Absolutely appalled when I go in there all the time.  I never not pay for my shopping!! I am a loyal customer of Tesco’s and to be treated like that.

I was deeply disheartened by the way I was treated during my recent visit.I purchased two items of clothing and paid for them separately to get a distinct receipt in case they didn't fit. Afterwards, I noticed one clothing item still had a security tag. As I was removing it in the designated area, an employee approached me harshly and told me I shouldn't be doing that. Despite my assurances that I had paid, he stood there watching me scan the rest of my groceries, making me feel extremely uncomfortable and unfairly judged.What made this even more troubling is that I am a person of colour. His behaviour made me suspect that my race played a role in how I was treated. As I left, he checked the system to see if I had paid, further implying I was dishonest.While I understand the need for store security, the employee's approach was inappropriate and humiliating. Tesco must train employees to handle such situations with respect and fairness, ensuring all customers are treated equally.No customer should endure such discomfort and embarrassment.

Now they no longer stock this size tray of thighs but they have increased drumsticks in this size tray to £4.70. Chicken thigh tray is now half the size at £3.30!Cadburys chocolate bars.

She realised she forgot potatoes and went back to get those and pay for them too. The staff had told security to watch my nan and the security then demanded to see my nans receipt rather than checking cctv. My nan got flustered and was crying. They continued to make her take all of her items out of the bags rather than take her straight to the person who served her at the till. In the end, they did find the receipt at the bottom of the bags. They eventually walked down to the person on the till who took payment from my nan. The man confirmed my nan had paid. She was in floods of tears and was so embarrassed. She barely got a sorry from the head of security, they just said sorry this is what people do and took no noticed of the anxiety and upset they had caused. She refunded all her items and none of our family will shop here ever again. Thank you to the one nice colleague who gave my nan the head office customer services number to file a complaint because she too understood how badly my nan had been treated. Everyone who was involved should be incredibly ashamed of themselves and should do better! Get your staff some training. Not everyone takes their receipt anymore, you have the option yes or no.

My order due between noon and 1pm will now arrive “by 15.05pm”. (This has since again further been moved to 16.35pm). However, the explanation they proffer of “delays on the road” is a complete and unashamed lie. I’ve queried this before with the drivers who are completely unaware that the powers that be are trotting this complete falsehood out to explain late deliveries. Definitely no delays on the road. Another hour and 20 minutes pass and I’m told that “due to a technical issue we won’t be able to deliver any of your chilled products today”. Now, I accept this - problems arise, of course they do but a) please don’t tell barefaced lies to your loyal customers about delays on the road, and; b) Zoe Evans at the UK Customer Engagement Centre don’t send emails 2 hours after the event and with typos in them. I moved my slots from a Saturday to a Monday morning as many staple items (bread, ham, milk) weren’t coming as they were not only unavailable but they could provide me with no suitable substitution (?!?!). However, I was told by more than 1 driver that the majority of pickers in the Crawley warehouse were youngsters and, after being paid on a Friday, simply, consistently, fail to turn up to do their job on a Saturday morning. This then means that the other members of staff were scrabbling round doing their jobs that they couldn’t be bothered to turn up for, as well as their own. In fact, the ONLY saving grace Tesco.com have is their drivers. Over the 15 plus years I’ve been a dot.com customer, the delivery guys are always polite, helpful, efficient and cheerful. Not one other member of staff I need to interact with to get my groceries delivered from Tesco has any one of these characteristics. In fact, I can pretty much guarantee that they won’t even respond to this review - they simply cannot be bothered to relate to their customers. It’s just not important to them to provide any level of customer service anymore. Date of experience: August 19, 2024",1

The person from Horizon Parking took images of my car, firstly from the front blurred, secondly from the rear obviously couldn’t be bothered to get out of the car as you can tell from the third image which showed the parking restrictions and that you couldn’t read because it was taken from a car or a tricycle maybe the latter. Anyway appealed and won but no apology from Horizon and still put the blame on myself.

I have been receiving products on their date, past their sell by date and with only two days on use by (which is not very helpful for a weekly shop). I have been making complaints almost weekly to the staff at Newton Abbot (as it seems Tescos are trying to fobb off their ‘unsellable’ products on home delivery customers!). I have been making notes on so many products asking for 3+ days on use/ sell by- this has been ignored on numerous occasions! This week is the last straw- I was told by the delivery driver the strawberries had a short date (the next day) I didn’t make a fuss as we would just eat them early. When I finally got round to putting my shopping away, more than half of the products had two days on them, wraps were on their date, garlic and lemons were mouldy. I messaged Tescos instantly and I am still awaiting a response. I am chronically ill with late Lyme and long Covid, so popping to the shops during the week for extra bits is very tough; I have emphasised this to Tescos numerous times regarding the quality of the products when delivered. Please do not shop with Tescos, I spent £80-£100 a week with them, which is a lot of money to just waste on poor quality products. Date of experience: August 16, 2024",1

I am a 55 year old woman who shops in this store 3 times a week. So my argument is why are parents with children allowed to buy alcohol or redbull , surely Tesco and its stupid rules and crusades should not allow this as they might be giving them to children.The training is terrible. The customer service is worse. Don’t try and make an example of the wrong people. Look for the people that need your intervention not the easy targets. I will be calling the head office about this.

We have used the home delivery service for the last 5 years, today (for the first time ever) my partner was 15 mins late home for the start of our delivery slot, typically the driver showed up during this time and would/could not delivery as our son is 16 years old and required an 25+ years adult. While at the door I spoke to the driver via our doorbell cam who told me he would return in 30 mins. To cut a really long story short he did not return, my partner spent 4 hours chasing our delivery on the phone speaking to 5 members of tesco online with each promising a phone call from the store. Eventually we managed to reach an advisor who actually listened to what we were saying and finally arranged a call from the store, unfortunately this call also didnt go as planned after some very weak apologies and having it pointed out to us several times it was ultimately our fault. Was told delivery was refunded (which we would not get back for several days) and the only slot over the next two days would have cost an extra £7...... we were obviously furious.The ONLY positive part of todays experience was the very nice advisor from earlier who much to our surprise followed up on our call to see how we had got on. She eventually rearranged our delivery for us (at no extra cost) and also for us a small amount of compensation.Words cannot describe how bad an experience today was for us and we may never use Tesco again, if it wasnt for your one call center advisor who actually took customer service seriously then we wouldnt even be thinking twice about spending our money with them again.Date of experience: August 16, 2024",1

When I enteredmy jaw dropped, this has to be the most immaculate Tesco I have ever shopped in, take a leaf you bosses, this  store had a feeling of love and more importantly, pride.The fresh produce was perfect, someone had taken the time and effort to make it so.The shelves were immaculate and the prices surprisingly competitive, the whole store was completely spotless, shiny and clean. The manager must either be a tyrant or an Angel, I am guessing by the standards in this shop, he can only be an affable character to achieve such high standards from his staff.

Resulting in injuries from glass shards and over 2 litres of split wine and glass to clear up. Tesco have taken away the remaining bottles and debris. Tesco assured us the debris would be preserved for root cause analysis. Guess what..? Tesco claim they accidentally disposed of the debris which, of course, prevented any analysis.  Classic brush it under the carpet tactics. Had these bottles exploded with anyone in their vicinity they would likely have caused life changing injuries. Despite this Tesco seem happy to undertake no review and continue to actively market the product. We can only post this caution as Tesco seem oblivious to the potential injury consequences of their continued sale of their “Finest” Prosecco. Ohhh - Tesco did “refund” the products. No offer of anything else related to clean up, damage or injuries. Tesco say you need to discuss with our claims handlers….  Zero out of 10 for customer care. As we were obliged to do in the face of Tesco abdication we referred to Trading Standards & Environmental Health.

579,Tesco,Sarah ,GB,"Aug 9, 2024","Three dreadful experiences Over the past few months I've had three very bad experiences with my local superstore. I have contacted customer service about these, each time I've been told it's been passed to the store manager, but nothing changes. The in-store complaints relate mainly to the self service checkouts and lack of manned checkouts, plus dot.com pickers. The self service is ineffective due to lack of staff, and the pickers block the aisles refusing to move. The other complaint relates to the fuel station, and the lack of customer service when things go wrong. The problem is, we only have Aldi and B&M as competition. While I'm very happy with Aldi, we all know there are some things you need to get elsewhere, which is why we need another major supermarket. The same applies to the fuel station - it's the only one in our town. Tesco have no incentive to up their game.Date of experience: June 15, 2024",1

TescoIn all fairness this review is about Tesco Filling Station at Lee Mill, not the shop, but I can’t separate them here. I have been a customer of Tesco FS (and store) for around 35 years, recently the petrol station had taken a downward spiral to a point where I will no longer use it. In the last few years it’s become tatty with pumps malfunctioning or not working at all, there is always something ‘out of order’. The vacuum, water and air vending machine no longer accepts cash, phone payments only, and as I don’t have a smart phone that’s no longer available., worse still is recently they went to ‘pay at pump’ only, I refuse this on two counts, one, I don’t want to put my card into the pump and two, I believe they will get rid of the staff in the kiosk to save money, more profits for them; they are often the most expensive petrol station in the area too. Last week I went to wash my car, the cashpoint was out of order, the car wash (as usual) was out of order, my daughter used her telephone to pay for the jetwash, it took the money but wouldn’t start. She went into the kiosk for help and they replied ‘it’s nothing to do with us’.

606,Tesco,Angie Lock,GB,"Aug 4, 2024","Stealth removal of items from basket during checkoutThis particular issue of you removing items from my basket has been present for a couple of months, and I’m at my wits end.  Your substitution policy is a joke and is costing me, every single week, a small fortune!  Substitution boxes are ticked in the basket, at the top of the basket page, it reads:  ""Substitutions, If a product isn't available on the day of delivery, our pickers choose a similar alternative where possible."" BUT, it also says in a different area of the basket: ""You have 3 unavailable items.  Unavailable products will not be substituted and will be removed from your basket.""  WHAT THE HELL TESCO??  Why would you remove something from the basket on a Monday, for a Saturday delivery, because it is out of stock on a Monday?I will give you an example of this issue with this weeks’ basket.I checked out my shopping basket early this week, for an order that is due for delivery Saturday morning.  I need to open and add something to my basket, but if I do this, it will instantly cost me at least £10, this is not including the item I want to add.   Why?  Because you won’t deliver something to me on a Saturday morning as it isn’t in stock NOW, on a Friday morning.  Despite your huge overnight deliveries throughout the week including Friday nights.  I’d also like to add that there are items that this regularly happens with, the repeat offenders, and this is why I checked out on Tuesday instead of later today, Friday.  It can happen to anything, and in mass.  So, if I open this current basket and check out, you will remove these items automatically, and I will need to order more expensive or less appealing items to replace them.  Then the currently out of stock items will become fully stocked overnight tonight and I won’t have benefited from this.  The cheaper option for me is, to not open the order to add the item I wanted to add, but drive to my local supermarket and physically purchase this extra item.  This comes at a cost to me, as fuel isn’t free!  It also comes with an indirect cost to you as my local supermarket is not Tesco, Morrisons will benefit from your highly inept substitution regime!Two weeks ago, I spent THREE HOURS amending my basket as every time I removed the out of stock items and replaced them with items in stock, by the time I checked out (which was FOUR times in a row), more items had gone out of stock.  Your stock is a ‘live’ thing, I’ve watched items go out of stock in a matter of seconds!  I don’t have this sort of time available to keep doing this, I work full time, I have family commitments, I refuse to keep spending this amount of time trying to checkout because of your stealth tactics and persistence in quietly removing half of my basket!Imagine, if you will, that I add items to my basket on a Monday, I then checkout on a Tuesday for a Saturday delivery as I’m too busy to do it during the remainder of the week.  An item that was in stock on Monday, is now out of stock on a Tuesday.  You then remove the item from my basket for the SATURDAY delivery because it is out of stock on a TUESDAY!  This is ridiculous!  This was previously not an issue, all the website used to say is “the quantity can not be increased”, but nothing was removed from the basket at checkout.  Usually, most things are restocked, and turn up on the Saturday mornings.  Very very occasionally, an item hasn’t come back into stock and that is when substitutions are then sourced or an item is simply not delivered.  To make things even more tricky for the consumer, and what makes this EVEN WORSE, is this:  Upon checkout, I will receive an email telling me what items I’ve added, and what items I have removed.  But you take things out of baskets and we have to GUESS what you’ve removed because there is NO email or message from you saying what you’ve done!  I spend, on average, just over £200 a week, every single week.  This guessing game is NOT FUN with a basket of this size.   It’s certainly enough to lose you customers.You are no longer contactable by email.  Your WhatsApp team are useless, phoning is pointless.  So I wrote a letter, printed two copies, sent one to your main customer services centre and the other to your head office.  Signed for.  Basically, emailing you to try and get this properly heard has cost me £8.  Because you don't accept emails... £8 !!!!!!!!!Date of experience: August 02, 2024",1

The final straw was last week when they took 7 days to deal with my normal prescription. The staff are hostile. They have siege mentality. Barriers have been erected 'to stand behind'.

Typical examples include simple things: my elderly mother loves bassets jelly babies. Tesco usually sell these for £3.50 a box; recently having a club card offer making them £2.98 (still only what stores like Home Bargains always sells them for). Today, Tesco have increased them to £4.50 a box!!!!!! Surely this is way above their RRP at approximately a 25% increase!The same applies to their Free From aisle putting gluten free warbutons rolls up to £2.90 now from £2.75!!!Why when no else has?Shame on Tesco for exploiting people still trying to cope with low incomes and worse: Celioac sufferers who have no choice but to buy overpriced gluten free goods.Date of experience: August 03, 2024",2

Nowhere is it said whether the product is suitable for freezing or not. Looking elsewhere online, M&S/Ocado and Aldi for example are quite explicit that their unsmoked diced pancetta is Not suitable for freezing.

As we were leaving the store, the alarm went off and we were stopped by one of your employees requesting to look at our (substantial) shopping and the receipt.Firstly, at the till we are typically asked whether we want the receipt, which for ecological reasons we normally decline.  As luck would have it, today we had no choice and we were given the receipt.  The receipt was long and your employee was not keen to go through all of our shopping (partially in a Waitrose bag and partially in our shopping trolley - we live close to the store and typically walk there from home) so he started to ask us questions about what we had bought that could possibly set off the alarm.After a few uncomfortable minutes for both us and your employee, we zeroed in on the offending item: 2 Cod Loins.  The packaging says “Security protected”, something we had not noticed when we picked it up.  (It must a new thing because we buy this very regularly.)  Unlike other items (e.g., some bottles of wine) which are also security protected, there seems to be no way to disable that protection at the till and the item will invariably set off the alarm.  The lady at the till did not mention anything about this, so we could not be prepared, say, by keeping the item on top of the trolley.  I hope I don’t need to tell what’s wrong with such a system.I hasten to add that the employee was courteous and we have no complaints about him.  I do, however, resent being thought a criminal and this is usually reason enough to stop shopping at a store.  In fact, the reason we go through the till and we do not scan as we shop is that the first time we did this we had a similarly unpleasant experience with one of your employees going through every single item we had bought to make sure we had scan them.  That left a very bad taste which I’ve still have not recovered from.  In fact, we also shop at the Comely Bank Waitrose and there we always scan as we shop and have never been had a problem.  You could perhaps learn a thing or two about how to treat customers from them.By the way, I sent this email to the customer service email I found for Tesco.  Their reply:  ""This email address is not monitored, and we will not be able to reply to your email.""  What a joke.Date of experience: July 27, 2024",1

On arriving in the store scanned my club card and it was blocked don’t know why..The assistant apparently unblocked it so we could start our scan and go shop. We had a large trolley full of shopping and went to pay for the shopping only to find yet again the assistant wanted to rescan every item of £174 shop. We weren’t very happy as this meant us waiting for them to rescan it all. We waited nonetheless like 2 weeks ago for them to tell us every item was scanned by us correctly. By this time everyone was looking at us as like we were thieves. We were furious the way we were treated. So we told them to put the shopping back and keep it and we would be spending our £174 elsewhere where we were treated more respectfully. There were other shoppers not being checked and treated as we were so we couldn’t understand why they were again picking on us..we are honest people and if Tesco can’t treat their customers right then they don’t deserve any..they certainly won’t be getting any more of our money thats it’s for sure!!

Their computer just sent us £58 of vouchers, with £25 off our next shop, £17 off the next, etc, to entice us back.   It is not price that drove us away but the offensive woke politics being shoved down our throat, so those vouchers go in the bin.The Tesco shareholders need to stop the abuse of position by their Execs and focus on their actual customers.

They’ve just taken my Clubcard points to turn into vouchers. I was about to use them for a cinema trip, but they’re telling me I can’t access them for 7 days now, which is too late for us now sadly. We can’t afford to pay for the cinema for all of us as we give most of our money to Tesco!!! Grocery, petrol (for car and work van), clothing, pharmacy etc!!

On 15th July 2024, while attempting to use the Tesco Clubcard app at the checkout, I encountered behaviour from your staff that I found both inappropriate and intrusive.As I was waiting for the app to load, a staff member reached out and touched my phone without my consent. This action was uncalled for and made me feel quite uncomfortable. Additionally, I was urged to hurry up, despite the fact that the delay was due to the app loading, something beyond my control.I understand that there may have been other customers waiting in the queue, but I believe there are more respectful ways to handle such situations. Touching a customer's personal device without permission is a clear invasion of privacy and goes against the standards of good customer service. I felt rushed and disrespected during this interaction.I have always appreciated the convenience and service quality at Tesco, but this experience has left me feeling disappointed. I would like to request that you address this issue with your staff to ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future.

704,Tesco,Shirley Rowarth,GB,"Jul 13, 2024","Tesco fraudulent practiceCalled into Tesco, Manchester Piccadilly. Picked up a packet of biscuits from the reduced area. There were black and white signs all over the section, stating 'reduced' The original price had been £2.90, and there was a price sticker underneath the biscuits marking them down to £1.45. I attempted to pay for them and they scanned at £2.90. I took an assistant to where the reduced section was and was told the £1.45 was the club card price. The manager also stated that to be the case. Surely the club card price wouldn't be 50% of the original price? And should it have been placed in the reduced section just because it was a club card item? This is a scam! I have seen this practice in other Tesco stores and the story is always the same.

705,Tesco,steve ,GB,"Jul 13, 2024","Tesco cafe. Great if you like dirty cups and frozen foodWe went for breakfast at the cafe in Tesco on the A127 at Southend/Westcliff.The meal is ordered at a machine. You are invited to add/delete items for your choice of breakfast. Additional items are charged for but no refund is made for items deleted.We ordered two English breakfasts with tea. When the tea arrived my cup was tea stained. I walked back to the lady serving tea and requested a clean cup. She grunted and handed me a cup that was dirtier than the first. My request for another clean cup was met with more grunts and the server made a cursory inspection of the cup before handing it to me. I assumed as she had inspected the cup it would be clean. When I went to pour my tea I saw there were multiple tea stain rings in the cup. More grunts, I was given another cup. Not one comprehensible word or apology came from the mouth of the woman whose job was to serve tea in CLEAN cups.Worse was to come. When the breakfast arrived, my wife cut into the has browns, they were frozen. The cutlery was also dirty.We pointed out the frozen food to the server and asked for a full refund. He made no attempt to check the food or offer any form of apology.Trying to complain to Tesco is virtually impossible. The receipt had a web address on for you to leave comments. When I accessed the website I got a warning that the site was unsafe and my personal details were potentially at risk. An email to customer services was met with an automated reply stating the site was not monitored. I tried phoning and there is no option for complaints. The system sends you round in circles, you never get to speak with an agent.I eventually made contact via whatsapp and was given two phone numbers that went through to exactly the same automated system. I mentioned the web address from the receipt and was told that the block was down to the settings on my anti-virus. I have never had any issues and if my anti-virus blocked the site it had detected problems.The woman serving the tea was rude, the food server couldn't have cared less, the cups were far from clean and the food was frozen.I will never use a Tesco cafe again, any self respecting pig would also find the conditions unsatisfactory.Date of experience: July 11, 2024",1

There was no wet floor signs down to warn customers of this. I went to the security guard at the service desk and ask him why there was no wet floor downs but he did not know what I meant so I went to the girl on self checkouts and told her what had happened. She apologised and called for wet floor signs that was done immediately. I was very angry as I was in a lot of pain and caused a bit of a seen which would all have been on cctv as it was at the entrance to Tesco. I was also very concerned as this could have happened to an elderly person and I told her this.I then contacted Tesco complaints department who immediately got back to me and took all details of incident. I contacted my doctor who referred me to a physical therapist. I have since put in a compensation claim against Tesco hoping they would take accountability for this error but today I received an email offering me a £100 gift card which obviously I will not be accepting as they are saying that what I am saying is obviously not true and they have a cleaner who does hourly checks and they have a strict procedure to keep there customer’s safe. I am in Tesco every day and have only once seen a cleaner once who was just mopping water up and actually making it worse rather than better. So I will be contacting a solicitor as all I really wanted was accountability for their mistake. Any advice would be appreciated. ThanksDate of experience: May 25, 2024",1

At 11 pm, without any prior notice or explanation, Tesco canceled my delivery.

Denied Alcohol Purchase at 46I visited the Tesco in Twickenham this evening after my gym session to purchase a few items for myself and my daughter. Unfortunately, I was unable to buy a bottle of wine due to not having my ID with me. At 46 years old, I understand the importance of age verification policies, but I believe common sense should also play a role.When asked for identification, I offered alternative forms such as credit cards, my Tesco loyalty card, and work ID. However, the staff refused to accept these, stating they were not valid for age verification purposes.While I appreciate the store's commitment to following regulations, I found the situation frustrating and unreasonable given my clearly mature age. As a black woman, I couldn't help but wonder if unconscious bias played a role in the staff's inflexibility. It's difficult to determine if my race influenced the interaction, but the experience left me feeling singled out and uncomfortable.I would appreciate if Tesco could review their age verification policies, provide clearer guidelines for situations involving obviously mature customers who may have forgotten their primary ID, and ensure staff receive comprehensive training on fair and consistent application of policies to all customers, regardless of race or appearance.A more customer-friendly and equitable approach in such scenarios would greatly improve the shopping experience for all patrons. I hope Tesco will take this feedback seriously and work towards creating a more inclusive environment for all customers.LeonildeDate of experience: July 02, 2024",1

Contact number on your website (0800 505 555 Monday-Saturday: 8am-8pmSunday: 9am-6pm) is not in use and refers you back to the website where the same number is advertised. Googled another number for a local store which just gave a central number 0345 026 9570 where any of the many automated options you pressed there was no option for enquiries / customer service. Eventually pressed 'groceries' (nothing at all to do with my query) where I got through to a helpful lady who transferred me to the queue for customer services. Finally got answered by Finlay who was not able to help nor put me through to the customer service or even just the local number for Tesco Havant. When I said that previously I had been transferred to the local store number to talk to them direct I was told 'they shouldn't have done that'. When I asked for Finlay's full name he wouldn't give it but gave me his employee number. When I asked to be referred up to his manager he wouldn't although told me his name 'Sean Ridler'. When I asked for their complaints number I was told there wasn't one and was given a further number 0800 505 555 which he informed me would come straight back to them. Useless and frustrating customer service Tesco! You don't deserve loyal customers with such an archaic contact system.

On pointing this out to Tesco, we were compensated for the cost and inconvenience - but, the contents could have been tampered with. It appears that neither is the order checked for ensuring that the order is complete by Tesco, nor is it ensured that the goods are in good order.Very frustrating, as we had to go out twice to replace items after already having paid for delivery.Date of experience: June 07, 2024",1

He even went the extra mile by inserting the coin back into the trolley on my behalf. This simple yet thoughtful gesture left me in awe, as such exemplary service is rare these days.Hassan’s dedication and pride in his work are truly commendable. His actions made me feel valued as a customer, and I am deeply grateful for his assistance. It was an honor to witness someone who takes such pride in their role and goes above and beyond to provide exceptional service.Please extend my sincere thanks to Hassan for his hard work and exemplary service. He is a wonderful individual and a true asset to your team.

( she is still in recovery from heart surgery ) The coupons were valid and followed the rules so i was shocked when i was told i could not redeem them because my coupon is worth £9 and the product was £8.55. Tesco’s reason was that they “don’t get credited for them because they are cheaper”. I asked to speak to the manager but he never came down and got sick of waiting . I worked in retail for 20 year ( head cashier at one point ) and processed many coupons less than the value of product in store and was never made aware of companies refusing to credit coupons providing all the terms and conditions are met . I did manage to get the product from boots and using another coupon in Sainsbury’s  , no problems, less than the price on the coupon . And boots said there is no problems getting reimbursed for coupons . Clearly “ every little helps” is not the case at Tesco .( Also the Tesco logo as well as other retailers were displayed on the coupon to show where they can be redeemed no mention of having to be the exact price ) I will stick to Sainsbury's going forward.

Fraught I returned to Tesco immediately to talk to the manager who was helpful but casually informed me that they can hold upto £120 as a deposit THE DIFFERENCE TO BE REIMBURSED 5 WORKING DAYS AFTER TRANSACTION, not many people have that kind of money spare.THEY JUST BASICALLY CLEAR OUT WHAT THEY CAN How is this legal? especially if what you are using is far smaller.It makes no sense. If they do this to many people it's obvious that they can make interest on everyone's misfortune.Luckily I can borrow my bill money from a relative but if they do this to young families or someone with no support it can cause extreme stress with potential dire consequences.I WOULDN'T MIND BUT I'VE ONLY GOT A TOYOTA IQ THAT CAN ONLY FIT £45 WORTH OF FUEL.The worst of it is they took my money but didn't actually fulfil any agreement ie putting in fuel within that specific transaction. SURELY THIS IS ILLEGAL I FEEL LIKE I WAS JUST MUGGED 2 DAYS LATER STILL NO MONEY IN MY BANK. I WILL NEVER SET FOOT IN TESCO AGAINIF I WAS YOU I'D MAKE SURE I'D PAY AT THE TILL OR USE CASH.

Thinking I was on safe ground, and knowing just how it works, as I had taken advantage of this offer so many times, I went about filling my trolley as usual. Much to the dismay of fellow shoppers, who I shared a few fun comments with.Then I got to the checkout, much to the dismay of those behind me in the queue, I off loaded 30 bottles of very drinkable wine, just as I have done so many times previouslyI engaged in a bit of fun banter with the lady on the checkout, as she finished passing on my many bottles I said: “This is such a wonderful offer, the last time I made this purchase I saved £79.00, 30 bottles of wine for just £181.00, you can’t beat that”. That’s when the lady looked at me and frowned, and when I saw that the amount owing was £284.50…I frowned too. Seemingly the offer had changed, it didn’t include everything on the shelves, as it had done previously, (it has never included wine under a certain price, but then I have never bought wine under that price).Nowhere did I see posters explaining this change, perhaps it was explained in the tiny type somewhere, but  I just thought I was taking advantage of the usual 25% offer. Now that is a very clever trick, on your part, use the familiarity to draw me in, and not just me, I’m sure. That is why I have labelled the new 25% offer the TESCON. I think I’ll now give TESCON a wide berth and wait until Sainsbury’s announce their 25% off alcohol, unless they have caught up with the dirty tricks of course. Then I’ll be off to Aldi!Date of experience: May 29, 2024",1

Prices are getting ridiculous while quality and quantity is reducing. Everything is smaller / less for higher prices. Odd how estimate weights are always under and never over! Ingredients on own brand products seem to be of inferior quality. Yet profits soar. Every little helps - clearly when it’s every little bit more money that Tesco can make from their customers.

I was wearing my jogging pants, T shirt and cap.Before I came Out of the self-check out area the security alarm at the check out area started going off and then I carried on to the exit and exiting as usual. So the alarms started going off before I even get closer. Suddenly the Tesco employee (not a security guard) stopped me and asked for my bags to be checked. I asked him how come you are stopping me and he said I could have any tags attached to any clothing and I showed him the bags and there are no cloths and he saw me packing the items and there were no clothing. I must admit, I was the only south Asian in the exit area (amongst the  white population) and I really feel strongly about this incident and I was targeted unnecessarily. This shows how Tesco has not trained their staff property and unnecessary racial incidences like these could bring bad name to them. Happy for anyone to checkout the CcTV camera for this incidence. I feel really ashamed and embarrassed. I will never go to Tesco anymore. The employee who stopped me was not a security guard and he saw me packing and paying for tve items in the self checkout. This behaviour by Tesco employee was totally unacceptable and I consider this as a racially targeted because of my appearance more than anything else. There were so many others (white people) were walking along with me and I was the one stopped. I will be asking the store HR manager to take this incidence to be investigated further.

No email to write to for feedback or complaints posted on the website. The whatsapp feature is laughable . . . you can write to that number, but there is a minimum of 15 minutes to get a response to every question you answer for them about your problem, and then you get a different person each time.  Too much robo.  Too little customer service.Here is the message to Tesco:  you sell primarily FOOD.  Your customers are HUMANS.  Quit inserting unhelpful and incompetent AI and robos under the guise of ""customer service.""  It's not.  It's annoying and irritating and reminds me why I prefer to shop at Sainsburys, Waitrose and Lidl.You might save 50p overall on a shop at Tesco, but if you shop carefully at Sainsbury or even Waitrose, you'll come out very similar at the cashier's desk and when there's a problem, they will fix it.

Had a delivery due from 10am to 2pm on the 26th may 2024 . Zoe evans emails delivery will be from 10am to 11am . Delivery hadn’t been delivered by 11.15am so I phoned up tesco customer services . Women answered and said the driver turned up at 10.45am and I didn’t answer the door which was utter rubbish and said my Security camera is on and no Tesco driver has turned up today .  Tesco Customer service women then said the driver didn’t want to deliver my order because of the note I left regarding the very sad male behaviour by a certain Tesco employee on 2 occasions when parking outside my house to deliver to next door , so I said which is it then ?, did he turn up or not . I explained this is the nasty behaviour by the welsh stalkers and trolls I live by who like to treat outsiders in this sickening way and the same people who had gotten me barred from Iceland foods even though I hadn’t shopped inside an Iceland foods store for over 4 years .The delivery instructions on my Tesco order reads = No rotten or damaged food or twisted male Tesco drivers behaving in a sad desperate way outside my property on 2 occasions when delivering to the toxic people next door , all on my security camera ok . I told the Tesco customer service women I’d email over photos of certain Tesco staff outside my property and maybe then she’ll understand why I left the note with my order for £149.04  . Call ended around 11.30am after the women from Tesco customer services said she would phone me back after she had first spoken to the manager at Tesco in Bangor . It’s now 12.54pm and she hasn’t phoned back at all . My Tesco order is coming up as order pending . I honestly believe the Tesco prat didn’t want to deliver my order because he couldn’t deliver without behaving in a sad twisted desperate way and that’s the welsh and there obsession with me and the numbers 2 and 3 . Had a few police or ambulance sirens going again as I’m typing this review , favourite think they like to do here in the dinas , Caernarfon, gwynedd community when pushing and excited about getting the English man down and out . Tesco had all morning to email or phone me regarding my order and delivery instructions left which they didn’t wish to do , again this sum’s up the sick dishonesty by the simple welsh in all professions and there push on one man who they haven’t stopped stalking and trolling and abusing since I arrived in toxic mad max north wales nearly 8 years ago .

She was too busy chatting on her mobile and says but, you have not bought the product so, there is nothing she could do.Another Lady at the counter was listening and advised me to bring the product and will give me £3 discount.As I was going to pick up the cat soup from the shelf, the first Lady who had refused to honour the displayed offer of £2 quickly met up with the kind Lady who was willing to honour the £2 offer which they forgot to remove the offer price.

At a time when the world is witnessing ruthless attacks on the people of Gaza and the West Bank, and the devastating impact of occupation on Palestinian communities, it is shocking to see Lidl supporting the economy of a regime responsible for these ongoing human rights abuses.The avocados Lidl is selling may even come from land that is illegally occupied – land where Palestinian families have been displaced. By choosing these products, Lidl is profiting from an economy linked to oppression and suffering. This is not just a poor choice; it is a violation of ethical business practices.I urge Lidl to rethink its sourcing policies and take a stand for justice and human rights. Until then, I cannot support a company that chooses profit over humanity.Date of experience: November 13, 2024",1
12,lidl,TommosTwentyFours,GB,4 days ago,"Success at LidlGB Stretched by Slow Service, Software Setbacks at Self-Checkouts, and Staffing Shortages Across StoresSuccess at LidlGB is clear, with a growing customer base, particularly in the South and London. However, this surge in shoppers requires more staff and efficient systems to handle stretched back-of-store queues.Speed is lacking—slowness is the reality. Many stores are struggling with stocking, servicing customers, and maintaining smooth operations. The software at the self-chuckouts often causes delays, making the process frustrating and inefficient.Service from HQ is sparse and slow, with reviews leading to substandard responses. Both store and HQ management seem more focused on savings, neglecting the need for better staffing and improved systems. Lidl must prioritise speed, service, and better software at the self-chuckouts to sustain success and prevent customer dissatisfaction.Date of experience: November 04, 2024",1

I recently thought that I was benefitting from a 50% discount on pizzas. When I got to the checkout however, the voucher didn’t work. Checkout staff were at a loss to explain why. I had two options, leave the (6) pizzas in store knowing that they would have to be dumped as nobody could say how long they had been out of the chiller or I could take the matter up with customer services. I chose the latter because I hate food waste.I contacted customer service only to be informed that there was an exclusion and that these pizzas should have been purchased from a particular store. I was told that I should have read all the terms and conditions before I tried to use it. Of course, we all have time to study all the terms and conditions of every offer we try to use.I explained that it was awful PR for a customer to feel cheated when they left the store. Simply put, they couldn’t give a t**s. I have been a loyal Lidl customer for over 10 years. I am now currently exploring options, perhaps it’s time to give Aldi a look.It was only a small amount in the grand scheme but it’s the principal of it.

I live miles away from a Lidl store so it's inconvenient for me to follow that useless instruction. I can call all other supermarkets who actually have a human being at the end of the line and all is done quickly, but with Lidl don't waste your time in using their useless Whatsapp service as it's yet another bot providing useless answers and don't bother using their phone number for customer service as no human being answers or comes to answer. Their number online is listed as 020 3966 5566. When automation takes over from person human beings the service is reduced to a large extent which can put people off from visiting such company stores. Moreover, you can't even search for any product on Lidl websites and if you do find a general product you are given no price! Tesco and Asda, Sainsbury's as well have an easy to navigate website with a search facility for looking for particular products and all prices are listed unlike Lidl. I suppose they are cheap for a reason but this lowers Lidl's standard of customer service which doesn't exist despite Lidle advertising that it does!Date of experience: November 07, 2024",1
66,lidl,Candy Y.,GB,"Nov 10, 2024","Bad experience In Epsom’s LidlFirstly, I noticed that Epsom Lidl’s self-checkout system now requires customers to scan a receipt before they can exit. For customers who choose not to make a purchase, this setup is quite inconvenient. Every Lidl supermarket offers a unique range of products, and sometimes customers may simply be browsing, especially for items like  different brand of electric blankets which may not always be available at Lidl. Requiring a receipt to leave adds an unnecessary restriction for such customers because the alternative of queueing for staffed checkouts is often time-consuming, making the self-checkout option preferable for many.Secondly, during my recent visit to Lidl in Epsom, I decided not to buy anything and was met with a very unpleasant attitude from one of the staff members as I was leaving. Their manner suggested a suspicion of theft, which I found offensive and unwarranted. Customers who do not make a purchase should be treated with the same respect as those who do, rather than facing uncomfortable scrutiny simply for not having a receipt. Furthermore, having a receipt doesn’t mean someone isn’t stealing; they could simply scan fewer items before paying in self-checkout machine. Does entering the supermarket mean that one is required to make a purchase? Are customers not allowed to leave if they don’t buy anything?I kindly urge Lidl to reconsider the necessity of scanning a receipt for customers to exit the self-checkout area and to provide staff with guidance on offering a respectful and welcoming experience to all customers.Date of experience: November 10, 2024",1

The new self-sevice tills keep playing up and people use them with a great deal of shopping, which causes long waits for the remaining tills (took nearly 10 minutes to use a self-service till and there was only about 2 people in front of me). Tonight three of the tills were playing up in a row (including mine) so delayed people going through the tills. This will only get worse, as it looks like your going to have to scan your receipt to get out (if you buy anthing at all) and will only cause more delay.Also with the new layout - it's changed massively so barely anything is where you would expect them to be now. The new product placements are confusing and very hard to know where to look for a lot of the things in the back of the store.

A complete waste of money!Old: Sept 24Bought six pies.This will be an updated saga of the awful pies that Lidl sell.1.First one had 1 teaspoon size minced chicken and 3 teaspoons of gravy in it. Safe to say it burnt dry inside, by the time it cooked on the outside. The bottom pastry was like rubber. The top pastry was perfect!Oct 242nd pie was ok but had the same bottom.Lidl decided to give me £6 back but the pies cost £9:50.Also, noting parking fees not just here at Lidl.

Reckless driving, car drivers doing doughnuts, creating grey smoke from their cars, loud music, drug taking, alcohol and other illegal drugs. This store has left the gate to the car park unlocked when it has closed, they have left the store without a suitable gate and lock for some years until recently. They have allowed anti social behaviour to occur, despite complaints, this store. Complaints have been made to the store since 2015, complaints have been made to Lidl customer services via phone calls and emails though nothing has been done to prevent this criminal behaviour. The anti social behaviour occurs at all times of the day. Early morning, afternoon, evening, late at night at various lengths of time. The response from Lidl below, is a response that they have been giving since 2015. Customer services or management, appear not place any concern regarding the issues I and other customers have raised regards the issues. Anti social behaviour causes detrimental effects for others.

In response he replied with an insult, calling me a “piece of nasty shit. This response was both upsetting and unexpected as a manager. I do not know what this guys manages, can someone explain???When I tried to address the matter with other staff, they were not comfortable, because they know how nasty he is.

This action only helped him to boost his ego. He perhaps believes that he is sympathetic, but he is not.  Given this manager’s persistent rudeness and dismissive attitude not just this time with me, it is ongoing. I am really concerned that Lidl continues to employ him in a position that requires customer service skills and respect, which this man lacks.As a regular Lidl customer, I spend over £100 a week at your stores, I expect a basic level of professionalism and courtesy. If there is always fight at the till point between your manager and customer, someone should deal with him. Such behaviour displayed by this manager does not reflect well on Lidl’s reputation and commitment to customer satisfaction.

However I did not think it was possible to pay £17 to charge my car (extremely slowly-was much quicker when the EV charging was provided by a company other than Lidl who are current providers). Shame on you lidl for allowing parking eye to issue a ticket to not only a regular customer but a customer who on this occasion paid £17 ro charge the car. The charger was very slow which was inconvenient but as my battery was low I had no choice. After 4 hours charging and 17£ later I still had nowhere near a full charge. To my astonishment today I received a PCN with a charge for paying to charge my car as it went over the hour and a half. I spoke to lidl customer care by a rude and unhelpful supposed customer care provider who advised the charge is accurate and that basically it's my fault as the small prints on the signage stipulates this. You may be legally allowed to do this but morally and  from a customer service point of view this is a disgusting, misleading and clearly wrong way to run business. How you can charge a not cheap price for a service such as charging a car (I did not leave it there longer than necessary) then punish me for leaving my car there for the time needed to provide charge is absolutely sickening. I should not have to read the signs that are up high to look for the catch when paying a high price for the service. I will be telling all my colleagues local to this lidl to boycott this place. Customer service was a joke worst I've ever encountered and refused to  lodge a complaint and stopped replying. I wasn't being rude or swearing or anything simply stating my case and was told my issue is with the parking company not them. No Lidl I expect private parking companies to be awful and have no scruples but I certainly don't expect what was in my eyes a reputable company like lidl to take 17£ (again lidl owned charger paid for on the lidl app and not the cheapest for the amount I charged) for charging extremely slowly and then fine me for having my car parked for 4 hours. This wasn't even near enough time to get a full charge its not like I was leaving it there necessary. Disgusted at this and the disgraceful response from customer service chat. Will never shop in lidl again and will certainly never  ever use their chargers again. I will be warning everyone I can to stay well away. Date of experience: October 02, 2024",1

It really is the cheaper end of all the supermarkets and I'm not really enticed by their poor offers or their low quality food and products. I did happen to go into one the other week and bought some of their 'luxury' range Italian ham and when I got home, discovered it was 6 days out of date. So, I decided to call their C/S team to let them know and was told I would receive a gift voucher sent to me and they would contact the store to remove the ham. We had to return to the retail park the next day and decided to pop into Lidl, to see if they had removed the ham but it was all still out on display and out of date! It’s now six weeks later and I still haven’t received the promised GV either. My friend told me the other day that she had to take a full box of steaky bacon off the shelf last Xmas, that it was pushed to the back, and it was FOUR weeks out of date and the manager of the store literally grabbed the box of bacon from her and walked off without saying anything.

As a person living with a disability, I recently experienced a distressing incident at your Crown Point branch. While attempting to pay for my items, a staff member insulted me and made a distasteful joke after scanning my items. When I asked him to stop, he walked away from the till, resorting to name-calling. Despite another staff member being present, I received no assistance when I inquired about the situation.Upon requesting to speak to a manager, a woman who claimed to be the manager began scanning items. When the previous cashier returned, I expressed my dissatisfaction, only to be rudely told to be quiet in front of the manager. The manager's response was even more shocking, as she said, ""What would you like me to do?"" Should I slap the cashier in the face? Throughout this ordeal, I repeatedly asked for the cashier's name, and the manager reluctantly agreed to check me on his name tag. As if this experience wasn't challenging enough, I was using a walking stick at the time. When I asked for the manager's name, she callously refused to provide it and directed me to check her name tag, which read ""Joanna.""I sincerely hope someone will address this issue with the shop's management at 411 Beulah Hill, Norwood, London SE19 3UZ.

178,lidl,norseman,PT,"Oct 17, 2024","A winter's tale at Lidl…Many of the complaints on these pages refer to ‘staff rudeness’.  But occasionally, a customer experiences something much worse than rudeness – such as physical injury.  One very cold day in January this year, after buying at the local Lidl store, I was walking across the supermarket car park when I slipped and fell backwards, my head striking the hard surface of the car-park.This was witnessed by two people, one of whom helped me back inside the store and called an ambulance.  The deputy store manager completed an accident report form, noting that (1) blood was coming from my head wound, (2) snow was falling at the time.  She later added (3) the car-park was gritted soon after my accident.  An ambulance was called, and I was taken to the local hospital, where the nurse said I had a two inch gash in the back of my head.  The wound was cleaned and sealed.  Fortunately, I suffered no fractures, concussion, or brain injury from falling, which could so easily have happened.I almost certainly slipped on a small patch of black ice inside the Lidl car park.  Minutes earlier, I’d noticed a young woman lying on the snow-covered pavement beside the main road, and attended by two policemen, a few hundred yards from where I fell later.  By contrast, inside the Lidl car-park, the ground surface appeared perfectly safe.  That is, until I fell!  The deputy store manager’s own written admission that this car-park was gritted soon after my accident is an interesting detail.A certain amount of correspondence then flowed between myself and Lidl.  I even sent a letter by Recorded Delivery to Lidl’s chief executive, who didn’t even bother to reply, thereby adding insult to injury! I later made a compensation claim to Lidl’s insurer, but my claim was disallowed on the grounds that I had supposedly not proved Lidl’s liability.  Lidl has shown no inclination to make amends for what happened to me that day: for staff merely to express regret cuts no ice, and words cost nothing.Falling is an unpleasant experience, especially when falling on to what had seemed a perfectly safe place a second or so before.  But falling backwards - and in the process, striking one’s head on a hard asphalt surface – is far more unpleasant, producing temporary disorientation and shock.  I was unaccompanied at the time.  The law, however, seems to take an unsympathetic view of any compensation claim that involves slipping on an outside surface in bad weather - as if the whole thing were either a deliberate scam or else a clear case of simple-mindedness. So given that legal stance, here is my advice, for what it’s worth.  (1) Well before bad weather sets in, stock up with lots of tinned food, packet food and frozen food, to be used only in emergencies when the weather is bad.  Then, you need not go out for a few days.  (2) But if you must go shopping, restrict your buying to nearby retailers in the centre of town, where the ground surface is probably sheltered by tall buildings – don’t visit retailers in more exposed locations, such as near open countryside, where my accident took place.I have suffered no other ill-effects from my fall, I still lead an active life and I do a lot of walking despite my 78+ years.  I am also a little wiser as to the ways of the legal world.Every week before my accident, I used to purchase £30+ worth of goods from Lidl,  which, over the weeks, months and years, added up to a tidy sum.  But Lidl, I shall NEVER AGAIN purchase from you.  So in the end, YOU are the real loser!Date of experience: January 15, 2024",1

186,lidl,Geoff,GB,"Oct 21, 2024","Lidl customer service is so poorI started writing this review and then decided to read other reviews to see what had happened to other Lidl customers. Almost not worth taking the time as Lidl really do not seem to care but just in case it warns other potential customers here goes.In August '24 I bought a Parkside table saw IAN  382534_2110. The box was sealed and did not appear to have been opened. When I returned home, a round trip of 40 miles, I discovered the saw blade protective cover and the spare saw blade was missing. So another round trip of 40 miles. I perseuded the manager to allow me to open another table saw and take the parts I needed as I had checked the contents of the original, and apart from the parts mentioned it seemed complete. Why risk another round trip if the replacement box had missing parts. As I don't have space in my garage to have the fully assembled table saw and my chop saw stand I waited until I actually needed to use the table saw for a refurb project in the house. On 3rd October I built the table saw only to find that the red cam lever was not attachedto the parallel  rail because the screw holding the two together had not been made correctly. It was not an ordinanry screw  or I would have replaced it my self. Not wanting another 40 mile round trip I contacted the telephone number on the box. The lady I spoke with in Lidl customer service said she would send me an email with details they required to complete a warranty claim. I provided this information by return which included full name and address, product details ( IAN and serial number), description of the fault, a picture of the fault and a picture of my receipt. I received an email immediately from Lidl to say they had passed on my details and the information I had provided to their agent, NOVO CSV. The following day I rreceived an email from NOVO CSV asking for exactly the same information as already provided to Lidl and which Lidl said they had passed onto NOVO CSV  ( from Lidl's email to me Thanks for sending the information that we need. We have passed everything to our Service Partner, the next step is they will contact you regarding your warranty claim. You should hear from them within 10 working days. If you don’t, just reach out to tell us.Look forward to sorting this for you.Take care,JoanneCustomer Care) Well they didn't pass on the information so after filling out the NOVO CSV form I sent it to them. That was on the 5th of October and then I heard nothing, not even a confirmation email. On  the 16th October I emailed NOVO CSV to ask if they had received my email and if they had did they rquire more information and if not what was happening. On the 17th October NOVO CSV emailed to say my email had been received, details logged and the spare part ordered. No apology for the poor communication and expected delivery date given.  The CSV of NOVO CSV stands for COMMITMENT, SERVICE, VALUE  by the way!It is now the 21st October and still nothing. I contacted LIDL customer service. The lady I spoke with said she would put me through to NOVO CSV. I told her my dealings were with Lidle as the seller and not NOVO CSV. She then told me to take the table saw back to the shop for a refund. I explained that that option would mean disassembling the product and another 40 mile round trip to the store where I bought it. This appeared to be of no importance to the Lidl representative who simply repeated that she could put me through to NOVO CSV or I could return it for a refund. I opted for the NOVO CSV contact. The lady I spoke with there said it had been sent out on the 18th October by Royal Mail. Again why not send a quick email to let me know. So Lidl customer service nothing short of awful with no real customer care at all. A 120 mile drive to put right their product defects is of no consequence. They did not pass on the fault details I supplied to them as the NOVO CSV operative told me Lidl only passed them a note of customer contact details.  Although Lidl responded quickly to my emails NOVO CSV failed to communicate any information unless prompted. So overall an awful experience. Next time Aldi I think.Date of experience: October 03, 2024",1

The arrogance and smugness of Lidl management is absolutely amazing. It's like they believe they're the best in the world and by banning me would hurt my ability to do my food shopping. What they don't get through their poorly trained thick head is that there are plenty of other shops around. I've been a loyal Tesco's shopper for years. I now do most of my shopping at ASDA. So, do I need Lidl? Of course not. Silly people.I do my secondary shopping at the Lidl on Easter Road, Edinburgh. This Lidl is only a 3 min. walk from where I live. On this occasion I stopped to pick up a few things I needed. After paying for my items I started to walk from the self checkout area when, what appeared to be a store manage, ordered me to put the shopping basket away. I don't like to be ordered around especially store staff, unless there is a very good reason, like I'm causing a problem that could result in hurting myself, another customer, a staff member or store property. I ignored this person and continued to walk away and exit the building. He began to tell me to put the basket away. I just continued. He proceeded to yell at me, but I don't remember exactly what he was saying given that his behavior, as a store manage, was not professional at all, and exemplified the fact that he had no customer training or knowledge. I do know given that I have been train in customer service, management, supervising and leadership. YOU DON'T YELL AT CUSTOMERS, unless there is a very good reason, and a customer not obeying your orders is not a good reason. If he would have asked me to put the basket away I may have complied. As I reached the exit door he followed behind me at ta distance and continued to yell at me. At this point I turned around at the same time he yelled at me that I was 'BANNED' from the store. I yelled back (this was the only time I said anything to him) FINE! There are plenty of other shops in the area. I eventually went through the door, down the stairs, and continued to hear this guy yelling his head off. I guess he realized I didn't take him seriously. I started to do most of my major shopping there at this Lidl, given that it's close to my home. I've been driving regularly to ASDA nearest me. After this altercation I'll go back to ASDA and continue my major shopping. For secondary shopping I'll to the Tesco's not far from where I live. At this point Lidl no longer has me as a customer. YOUR BANNED LIDL!  Response to Ash.Hi Ash, I did write to Lidl about my experience, before posting my experience here. I received a response and was told that the matter will be looked into. I’ve not heard a thing afterwards. Given the reputation of Lidl I don’t expect any further contact or anything to be resolved about this.I just realised, after reading many of these posts, that, one; Ash’s response is just a canned response. Mostly likely a bot.Secondly; it’s perfectly obvious that Lidl’s top management has no concept of customer management and don’t care. They’re in it for as much money as they can earn, keep things on the cheap, including not spending a dime on management training.After reading these posts why would anyone want to shop there?

197,lidl,Jacek Oronski,GB,"Sep 14, 2024"," If you like to suffer distress and pain buy Lidl branded foods . On April 15, 2024, it came to my attention that Lidl Great Britain Limited, registered under company number 02816429 and classified under SIC 47110, distributed contaminated Lidl-branded foods to the public. Why this situation came to my attention anyone could ask ? Well ,maybe because I purchased some product lately and aI got myself involved in this quite a pickle type of a situation .Now I also know as learn that this contamination incident poses a severe risk of food poisoning and internal organ damage to consumers, thereby endangering public health and safety and I want to share it with you just to save you unnecessary suffering and distress. The Nature of Contamination: The contamination involved the presence of foreign manufacturing debris found in Lidl-branded food products. Despite being notified of the issue on April 15, 2024, Lidl has failed to initiate a product recall or provide a satisfactory response within the stipulated timeframe of 10 working days but acted with immediate effect only after approx. 30 days time when NFSA got involved  ,(Thx NFSA guys) .Anywho ,This lack of Lidls action and no urgency demonstrates a concerning disregard for product safety and consumer welfare.  Is this a Food Crime. The company’s deliberate decision not to adhere to established safety standards and intentionally breach the requirements for retail license accreditation constitutes a criminal act rather than a mere lapse in food quality management. A mistake can be characterized by errors occurring during unregulated and unsupervised activities. However, a willful disregard for regulations equates to a violation of the law. This distinction is crucial for understanding the severity of the infraction. Compliance with regulations is not optional but a legal obligation; failure to comply is, therefore, a clear breach of legal standards.Lidl’s released the food product to the public, without proper quality control, presents a poisoning threat. This is a Fact, based. Foreign objects found in the food resulted in food poisoning and other symptoms shortly after ingestion is another Fact. Lidl requested providing the contaminated product for testing is another Fact. I delivered Lidls contaminant to Lids own choice of address in Lidl own facility for testing. This is another Fact. Lidl confirmed, I repeat again, upon Lidls own choice of facility inspection in their own Lidl product Lidl confirmed the findings of foreign matter debris in Lidl’s branded foods. This is statutory Fact and this fact his was confirmed by evidence from Lidl’s own investigation and conducted with the involvement of the NFSA later. Fact. All facts.Regardless of the bad health symptoms due to the ingestion of Lidl contaminated food aside of unfortunate tertiary health comorbidities also some other people are forced to live with it too I experienced wasted time with my family which frankly infringed my statutory human rights and limited my access to healthy life enjoyment where incurred losses on other pre-booked arrangements  aside, in which I could admit I don't participate often but ware kind of important for me at that particulate time, are not ideal . Regardless, all of the above and more explained in depth at every stage of time consuming ,now pointless communication with Lidl business was broadly ignored by Lidl representatives proving clearly how much other human fellows' safety, human health and human life and all the human related aspects are worth for Lidl business. Unfortunately, Lidl’s deliberate ignorance and lack of accountability reflect poorly on their commitment to consumer safety. This is evident, especially considering all the steps taken and the factual aspects of Lidl’s behavior, including their lack of goodwill in initiating any form of compensation for the costs incurred due to their sale of contaminated products. This situation reveals Lidl’s disregard for humane problem-solving and accountability.Lidl has the chance to resolve the problem internally and improve their quality control processes. When a harmed person expects a decent approach in a case of accountability like this, the lack of decency, such as the absence of a voluntary proposal for compensation for suffering and losses incurred solely due to Lidl’s own negligence, clearly shows the nature of the company and its people. This is not a bargaining or settlement case because the retailer failed to follow food industry standards and regulations, resulting in poisoning people with their products and causing significant harm. Instead, it is a case of malicious, intentional neglect with the intent to harm by undermining all social aspects of the retailer's responsibility for safe, regulated sales to the public.Date of experience: April 14, 2024",1

I will not be shopping at Lidl again, it would not have bankrupted a multi million pound company to refund £11.98 WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MUCH CHEAPER THAN LOSING MY FUTURE CUSTOM, especially with the cost of living crisis that is effecting every one and even more so with disabled people, but I guess that they are no different to any other supermarket MONEY COMES FIRST.

209,lidl,Roger Walters,GB,"Sep 10, 2024","App-solutely hopelessLidl make a great deal of fuss about their Lidl Plus App, and the savings and rewards it can generate for customers.The trouble is, more often than not, the App simply does not function. This is NOT an issue with my device (it is an iPhone of recent vintage), and I have frequently seen other customers experiencing difficulties with the App at Lidl's check out. Additionally, more than one member of Lidl's staff has confirmed to me that the App has poor functionality.On 3rd September, having qualified for the Lidl App's 10% off coupon, I spent well over £100, and so was entitled to a discount of £10 / £11 off my bill. When I encountered difficulties at the till, I was initially told that as in store staff have no control over the App, I would need to resolve the matter by phoning Lidl Customer Relations. Are Lidl for real? I forced a solution by explaining to Lidl's Manager that neither I nor my shopping were going anywhere until the issue was sorted, and my duly earned discount received.Roll forward to today, 10th September. I saw I qualified for two free items. However, during my time in-store, the App began to malfunction (as per usual), and it was clear that if I checked out the two ""gifts"", I would in fact be charged for them. As a result, I left the ""free"" items on one of Lidl's shelves, and switched off the App before checking out.I see that Lidl UK's Trustpilot score is well under 2. I do not sense that this position is of any concern to Lidl (although it should be). I will dispense with their hopeless App, and most probably transfer Lidl's share of our food shop to Aldi (boring maybe, but more reliable).Date of experience: September 10, 2024",1

I feel very disappointed with Lidl and I think I will not buy anything from them anymore.Date of experience: August 30, 2024",1

However I may as well have been invisible because 4 staff members in total completely ignored me and actually walked away.Now I am beginning to understand why I rarely see anyone who is visually impaired or blind shopping in Lidl because if this is how they're treated like they're not important I can't blame them.After getting frustrated of being ignored I put my basket down and left the store feeling frustrated and I would like Lidl to tell me what they do to educate their staff when it comes to equality.Also I'd like to highlight how frustrating the auto checkouts are for VA / Blind customers as they rush you to scan your items yet when you're visually impaired it can take you a while to find the barcode.

I asked for them to check the CCTV and it would show I did nothing wrong they refused to check the CCTV saying only the police can access it which is rubbish, CCTV is held locally as anyone with CCTV will know, it would prove that the the store manager is lying and the blond member of staff was as well, she was not able to see to the back of the store while on the checkout serving customers. and only an elderly customer was near by, I asked for the bloke to escalate my complaint to the area manager as it was the store manager who had a go, but in reality the CCTV footage will not be working, or will disappear, conveniently, All I wanted was to get some orange juice, yet a member of staff can have a go, and why because I'm disabled and because he's the store manager, and can get away with it.

My local branch of Lidl has been trying to pawn off rotting food to paying customers for years now and despite complaints it only seems to get worse.  Inside every sealed plastic bag of fruit, at least one piece is rotten.  The other day I went to buy some sugar snaps and they were only fit for the compost bin.  Coupled with this are sky high prices.  Basically they are a company  content to rip off their customers.  Oh and let’s not forget their back breaking baskets.  Too large and heavy to carry around so you drag everything around the store and then hurt your back at the check-out either trying to haul the thing up onto the conveyor or having to bend down individually for each item.  You can also forget about buying a loaf of fresh bread from the bakery after 3pm.  Those shelves will remain empty until close at 9pm!  Last but not least, in a rush?  You may think you can nip in for a couple of items but guaranteed you’ll have to queue for at least 10 minutes if you want to get served by a real human being rather than self-checkout.  The staff at Lidl try their best but as someone else wrote, the rot starts at the top. This corporation’s disdain for their customers is unbearable, bordering on discriminatory.  They know that poor customers getting home from a weekly shop on the bus with kids in tow are not going to have the luxury of jumping back into their car and wasting half an hour arguing the toss over a whole bunch of rotten bananas carefully concealed in the - oh so many - plastic bag.  (Every Lidl bit of plastic going into landfill 👏👏👏) No.  They’re literally banking on them sighing and throwing them in the bin.

We,myself and my son,were buying quite a bit of stuff. I saw some LED lights which I wanted. As is often the case, in lidl many of the boxes where open. I told my son to get the remaining 4 but to check them as the boxes were open. My son checked and one of the boxes had missing batteries, so I told my son to get the other 3 and leave that one. . The security/guardShift manager Emad, confronted my son and told him not to open the boxes(which would be fair enough, had they not already been opened). My son explained he was checking the boxes as they had been opened. The security, Emad,said don't open them ,buy them ,take them home and if there's an issue bring them back. My son pointed out that this was a ridiculous suggestion,when it was obvious the boxes had been opened,and all he was doing was checking everything was there,which it turned out it wasn't. As I'm sure many of us who have shopped at lidl will attest ,opened boxes etc is a regular thing and to be honest,it would not be the first time I'd taken something home,after buying it from there,that something was missing. The security/shift manager,(obviously they are short of staff ,so the guy was doubling up on his role,) refused to accept what my son was explaining, in effect,accusing him of stealing. My son said ""you can see all three lights in my mums trolley and the one left there,non have been taken. We had over £300 of goods in the trolley so why steal something worth less than £3? My son continued to explain that we are buying  all the ones left,only leaving the one with no batteries. I asked the guy,Emad,Whats the problem was and he stood,hand in pocket,right in my face and said I'm telling everyone not to open boxes.i then said ,but they were already opened. Why are you making such a big deal? To be honest,I was massively embarrassed as Emad was definitely making his presence seen and felt,and all customers were aware. I told him ,don't you dare accuse us of stealing,to which he replied,then don't open boxes.  WE HADNT OPENED THEM!! THEY WERE ALREADY OPEN.He was rude,arrogant and extremely confrontational. My son said leave the shopping and let's go,to which he replied ""go on then"" very smugly. I said no ,I've come here to do my shoppIng and im not leaving without it. To which Emad said ""You're not getting a choice"",all this time,standing inches away from my. He was intentionally trying to stir something up and standing very close,with a smug grin,trying to wind up the situation. Unfotunately I  rose to it telling him ""how dare you,you are obviously looking for a reaction"" to which he replied,whilst smirking ""go for it!!"" . I was furious and shouted at him again""how dare you"" ""what exactly is it you want me to go for?"". My son asked him not to be so rude and intimidating  to his mother, and to  please be respectful. He just smirked,hand in pocket,obviously, as previously said trying to get a reaction. I did get truly angry and asked exactly what are you asking ne to go for in such an intimidating manner? I am an older woman, so he obviously wasn't too wary of me but I believe was looking for a reaction to his rude behaviour from my son to create a scene. He was most definitely on a power trip. I left there in tears. He walking right behind ne ,as if escorting me out,the only thing that was needed was his hand in my shoulder. He was so close i could feel his breath.. I asked him to stand away from me and stop making  it look like he was escorting me out,he refused,at which point the deputy manager,Harry,who he had called to get involved,asked him to go away and ""you are antagonising the situation"". His whole manner,demeanour and spoken attitude,was rude,confrontational. Such a person should not be in this type of role. His interpersonal skills were sorely lacking and his management and de-escalation skills were non existent. He had obviously had a boring day and was attempting to stoke something up.

It was a unique concept. Couple of days ago I thought I go to Lidl and see if the situation has changed or not. Unfortunately I think they've lost it. The goods standards has dropped. I left before because I was not happy with the management decision to put prices up, offer lower quality and also cut their quantity. I understand that the prices has gone sky high, but one can sacrifice the higher pay but why the quality and quantity? Are they getting greedy? I think that they are wrong.Example: Lidl used to have the ""Best"" chicken out of ALL supermarkets including M&S ! But all changed, now when you buy their chicken and keep it in the fridge, after couple of days it stinks! Even it has another 3 days of use date on it and also the beef goes black in the fridge after couple of days! It is not fresh.The Olive oil was great and was £2.75 when the other places were £6. Now their olive oil is £7 and others are £8! (own brand), why so much difference?They had the best tasting Baby plum tomato, but now they are not very nice and the quantity is halved and the price is the same as al  supermarkets. Also all salad section has turned this way.They had best pasta sauces and stuff like Piri Piri sauce which were unique, but now they have very ordinary stuff and in Sainbury's you can buy it much cheaper!These are some examples.I hope the management can find a way to find good deals with good quality and pass it to their customers!

Time 3:30pm when I was checking out I am not one to complain about service. I know sometimes people are in a rush, and maybe they forget to ask if you need your receipt, or say hello to you, or wish you a goodbye, or to look at your as you are standing before them, and somehow forget to say a single word. But all of these things just happened at my visit today to Lidl. I am a newer customer of yours. I did miss a week or two, as my Mum passed away, and I just couldn't handle being out and about. This was one of my first bigger trips out-the weekly shopping. Something I look forward to with Lidl, as there is always something new and interesting, your staff are usually quite friendly and these are all important to me and where I choose to spend my food bill. I was absolutely shocked today when I came to my time in the queue for me to see the check-out assistant. I looked at her and smiled, and she made no contact with me, whatsoever. She looked away the whole time. She was not speaking to someone else, she was not training someone, she simply ignored me. She never asked if I wanted a receipt, she didn't engage at all. I want you to be aware of this, as I know times are hard for all of us, including our favourite supermarkets, which in my case is Lidl. I know I am also feeling low, due to  grieving the unexpected death of my Mum. Of course, the checkout person wasn't to know that. However, as a common courtesy, great customer service and just human decency, I am shocked and still feeling very badly about walking out of your shop being treated like I didn't exist.

Hello there, I would like to share my troubling experience at Lidl, located at Whiteley, Rookery Avenue, PO15 7FN, on August 15, 2024, at 16:13 (receipt number 1669 413608/06).When I asked to speak with the manager, a staff member claimed to be the manager and treated me with complete disrespect as a customer. I was subjected to verbal and emotional abuse by this individual, who even attempted to block my path and threatened to remove me from the store, preventing me from continuing my shopping. This incident occurred after I brought to his attention that the scale in the produce department was not providing accurate weights, as it was unstable on the shelf and had a default of over 300 + grams. The staff member dismissively stated that the store didn’t need a scale at all. I pointed out that if it was there, it must have been deemed necessary by the actual manager.His response became increasingly angry, disrespectful, and abusive, making me feel the need to speak with a higher authority. He continued to block my way and threatened to kick me out of the store, even stating that I would no longer be allowed to shop there. I found this behaviour shocking and completely unacceptable.Eventually, I asked another staff member to call the higher manager. The higher manager said he would address the issue with the staff member privately, which I respected. He then cut a piece of cardboard from a fruit box, placed it under the scale, and the scale finally showed zero grams. However, there were no apologies from either the higher manager or the abusive staff member, despite other staff members overhearing the entire incident through their communication system.The behaviour I encountered was appalling and made me feel unsafe in the store.I hope that appropriate action will be taken to prevent this behaviour from being repeated with other customers.Date of experience: August 15, 2024",1

They cant get the back image of my car because my car never drove in and out of their car park.

She said that the higher price was correct. I told her that the price ticket for the location I lifted the Blueberries should have shown the higher price. I replied then that the price ticket should have been changed as it did not reflect the product stored in the position  on the shelf. She called the Manager who said that Lidl policy is to use available shelf space. I replied that the appropriate shelf space was then incorrectly priced and that I should be charged the price shown on the shelf. The manager disagreed with me.

Well that's fine with me; there are plenty of other supermarkets to choose from. So if lidl have both a stock problem and customer service problem, then I will definitely shop elsewhere. What is noticeable is that Lidl obviously can't be bothered to monitor and respond to any complaints raised here on Trustpilot, as there are no replies made to any of the issues raised by customers. Obviously they couldn't care less. They will find that eventually enough people will have received terrible customer service and Lidl will get a terrible reputation to match.

Contacted customer services who said they would transfer it to their insurance department. I was told the investigation would take up to 90 days. The accident happened on 7th Feb, 2024 and yesterday 16th May 2024 I received an email with the outcome. Lidl had been found not to be at fault. The reason was because they complete the necessary paperwork to say maintenance checks are completed as required. They admitted there was a dip in their paving stones because on the day they checked there was a puddle. The store manager said that all necessary paperwork was completed and the area manager said he made checks every six months and that neither of them could see anything that would suggest they were at fault.So my trip and fall that I had on their uneven paving that left me with a badly bruised knee, swollen ankle and sore wrist and having to be helped off the floor by two high school boys, must have all been in my head??? The subsequent not being able to walk on my ankle for six weeks must also have been in my imagination.I don’t appreciate being branded a liar which is basically what their investigation was trying to suggest.The store in question we have used since it opened around 16 years ago. However it will be a long time before I shop at Lidl again.I am 53 with a chronic health condition and the fall caused additional pain that I could well have done without. I should mention that the toe of my low healed boot made contact with a raised paving stone and before I had time to react I had fallen forward banging heavily down on my left side.If there had been cctv outside the store that would have proved I had fallen.Absolutely disgusted with Lidl GB. The store is used by many pensioners. I would hate for one of them to trip and have a fall like I did. One thing for sure is the Lidl didn’t give a toss. They don’t even have a decent complaints department.The lack of responsibility from Lidl is very concerning. It doesn’t matter how much paperwork they complete, it doesn’t change the fact that uneven paving on their land caused me to fall.Store: Wigan, Preston Road, Standish.Please note: As of today, 9th Aug,  2024, the paving remains uneven.Date of experience: February 07, 2024",1

The security guard was very closely observing us in a such a way it made us feel uncomfortable and it was very clear it was less about him deterring us from steeling or trying to catch us in the act of steeling but it was more about making us feel unwelcome (unwelcome in a store we've been shopping at for at least 3 to 4years).What made this much more disturbing is that I have been shopping at this Lidl for many years now and never experienced this issue. I have actually had conversations with many of the cashiers. I personally am American and have been living in Bournemouth for years now, but I am of means. My partner is Spanish, with a law degree and a liquor license with which she manages a popular pub up the street meaning she knows all local law enforcement and emergency response workers in the area. Our two sons were with us and we were all very cleanly and professionally dressed because we just arrived back from the airport after going on vacation. There was no rational reason for this security guard to be watching us so closely other than the fact that he was clearly new on the job and seemed to think because I was black, I must be up to no good. I felt uncomfortable, so I left with one of our sons and my wife stayed behind with our older son to pay. When she came out of the store, she said he made her feel awkward too and kept standing close singling her out and staring at her until she paid as well and she is Spanish. Considering we have spent more money and time in that store than this security guard ever has and we would like to continue shopping their with our young boys of color. I pray to god this does not happen again. However if it does, I will be sure to document and take legal action in a sincere desire to ensure there will always be a most tranquil and peaceful community for all going forward, especially those like my sons.If this event at the Lidl on Holdenhurst road, at 12pm, Sunday, July 21st, 2024 wasn’t so out of character from all of the great experiences I have had shopping there over the past 3 to four years.

363,lidl,expret.org,GB,"Updated Jul 12, 2024","EXPIRED items - WRONG price labels - UNSAFE food on shop floorI have stopped shopping at Lidl for quite some time for several reasons. 1. They now put FIXED unmovable price tags on the shelves. Exprensive items are often moved behind the cheaper price labels to spread out the stock. I understand that Lidl have mystery shoppers checking everything and staff move items around to make shelves look full. But it's uncceptable to keep moving expensive items behind cheaper labels knowing very well that most customers don't look closer at the items versus the price labels. Customers usualy also don't notice when their shopping is more expensive expecially when they have a full cart, not realising they took an expensive item that was placed behind a cheaper price label. I used to move the labels myself as this p**d me off, but Lidl now replaced the shelf labels with unmovable fixtures. 2. Too many self-chck-outs and purposely less staff manning the tills to safe money on labour costs while Lidl and all supermarkets made record profits during the pandemic. Chicken, fish, cheese, milk etc. are often sitting in baskets on the floor that customers leave behind to leave the store as waiting time is too long. These high risk foods are then put back into the fridge, god knows how long they were on the room temperature shop floor. Customers may take a raw chicken home with has a good expiry date but might find it started to go off, not realising it was on the shop floor for hours before being returned to the fridge. 3. The nail in the coffin for me now - I went in beginning of June to do a bulk shopping of milk, water etc. as I had a friend visit. Unfortunatley only yesterday I saw in shock that the Oat milk expired in March 2024. As I don't have the receipt anymore and even if I had the receipt, it would be hard to prove that these milks are purchased in the beginning of June. This ""greed"" is unacceptable at the cost of the few staff who do a back-breaking job and customers whose waiting time is extended as well as health compormised.

367,lidl,George Turnbull,GB,"Jul 11, 2024","Atrocious Customer care from Lidl and their supplier, Novo CSV LtdI required a replacement part for my defective Lidl High Power Washer and approached their supplier *Novo CSV Ltd (0333 222 9923) on 4 April.  I was given a part number through the Customer Care Department and before ordering, I enquired about fitting instructions.  I was then told that I had been given the wrong part number, and then given another one.  On making further enquiries I was then told again that I had been given the wrong part number and that I should order part No. 91097400.  I did on 14 May, for £28.49.Unfortunately that part did not fit my power washer and Customer Care have been blaming me for ordering the wrong part.  Their  service has been atrocious, taking up to 14 days to answer simple emails.  Finally, whilst still being accused for the error – although I have written evidence to the contrary – I was sent labels to return the erroneous part to them, for a refund.  I did, and they received it on 26 June.  I have received no further response from Novo CSV Ltd.Their mantra: Commitment – Service – Value, is a laugh.  I have seen none of that in dealing with the company.  I have even written to both of their Managing Directors separately, and the first letter was received on 25 June.  No response there either, after more than 13 weeks since I first contacted Lidl’s supplier.  I am out of pocket and have spent an inordinate amount of time on this issue – I have a Lidl High Power Washer, which doesn’t work – and still have a patio that needs a wash.  No mention of compensation mentioned either for out-of- pocket expenses or time wasted on their incompetence.  I’ll be buying a washer now from Aldi.Lidl did make a goodwill gesture on 6 June, but they seem not to be able to influence their supplier Novo CSV Ltd to take any positive action.  It is now 11 July.  They just don't care.Date of experience: April 04, 2024",2

I don't attemp to go through the checkout anymore as I think I am going to get refused again. I am just getting fed up of isles blocked and too high fridges so I have no chance to get my shopping.

Most of the Lidl foreign food specials they have taste bland and just not nice, but are packaged nicely and I buy new ones to try and then am almost always disappointed.  Their salad boxes are usually sold out - stock is sporadic and not really reliable.  Same with the bakery stuff.  I do like the sourdough but it's too expensive. They used to have healthy veggie protein snacks which I loved but have now disappeared from the shelves.  However some of the products are healthy and cheap-ish.  All the tills are self-service and the queues are usually atrocious.  I used to enjoy shopping there but now usually regret it.

I set to have go and find somewhere to sit down I will deal with the shopping payment then I realized that the manager was behind the cashier standing & Whispering With the Cashier And pointing me When the cashier was scanning the item, the manager made her check inside the trolley first. It didn't feel nice, but I said maybe there were some issues. But the main issue started when I told the cashier I drank a small bottle of orange juice and I left it on one of the shelves. The manager interfered and grabbed a big, large bottle and scanned it, although I told her that it was not a huge bottle and I did not take that size. The manager ignored me and the cashier just followed the orders and charge me for a large bottle of orange juice. I saw it’s a long queue full of customers, so I said let me finish and come away from the till & then discuss about this issue with the Manager, the Manager just walked away. I try to call her but she ignored me. I said to the cashier please can you call your manager? She called her when the manager returned. I said this was not a good customer service experience and she replied to me. Customer service is not for you. You just come and steal from our shop and eat and think you don't need to pay for it. I was shocked! Then I told her 'Do you have any evidence? You cannot accuse me in front of everybody without any evidence! ' Then she got angry and said she will call the police. I said, 'Not a problem. Call the police. Then she called her colleagues to come and send me out of the shop, and she shouted at me saying you're not allowed to come into the shop anymore! My Wife was trying to rest but panicked Rush towards me Ask What is going on? ! I saw that it's useless talking with the manager, so I started talking with her colleagues who looked more sensible. I told them what happened and what the manager is accusing me of. I am not at all happy with this custom service and I want to complain. I try to get the manager's name, but it was useless and the colleagues just advised me is better you go and just finish it here. So, my wife and I left the shop very disappointed with the customer service. I shop twice a week & happy with Lidl products, but this behaviour and attitude are not acceptable and cannot be tolerated I know it was a bank holiday afternoon maybe tired after a long shift and I really respect it, but I am sure if the Manager was trained should handle the situation far away better! My hope is that this bad experience will not happen again for any customer! Date of experience: May 06, 2024",1
517,lidl,Sophie Waring,GB,"May 8, 2024","Food poisoning from Moldy Blueberries My partner went to Lidl in Mansfield Woodhouse on 08/05/2024 at around 8.05pm, he didn't get a receipt as he only brought food items which we were going to eat anyway. He brougbt icecream, brownies and blueberries. To our horror, after eating a few of the blueberries and they tasted off, we checked the pack only to find they were moldy! Rotten! Out of date! White and Fuzzy! Squishy! Smelt horrible and tasted even worse! Horrible white mold and what ones weren't moldy were badly out of date. Obviously we stopped eating them and felt really sick, learning we had just eaten rotten, modly blueberries. Both me and my partner both threw up about 40 mins later and we both felt incredibly sick and our stomachs were extremely painful and we were throwing up for about 30 mins in extreme pain from these. We were just going to throw them away as they weren't expensive but after giving us food poisoning, I just don't think it's good enough. I imagine diarrhea and more sickness will follow in a few days along with more stomach pains. We both feel extremely ill and even though I think we have throw most of it up I think we will be ill for a good few days because of these out of date blueberries.We stared shopping more recently at Lidl and really liked it as we only live down the road but this has really put us off and honestly think we might boycott it for a while and maybe just all together. I have tried to complain as its not good enough and we can't be the only ones who have ended up with rotten out of date food that's made us seriously ill. Seriously do people at the store not check this, we couldnt even go back to the store as we felt so sick. I dont expect much to come from this but I feel like I need to report it. I have images I have sent them and if I could add the images here i would but theres no option to add images so i hope they got them on the complaint form i filled in. Disgusting and disappointing, thanks for the days off work we didn't need and a trip to the doctors or hospital. Date of experience: May 08, 2024",1

My wife pleaded to the staff to allow my daughter to use the staff toilet as Lidl don’t believe in providing toilets to customers. Lidl customers are aliens who don’t need to use toilets it seems. The inhumane security guard (not the regular one I should stress) refused but the lovely lady on the counter (wearing a vail) tried to help but we would have had to wait as she was serving. I had no choice but to walk out to take her somewhere to use the toilet leaving all the shopping on the conveyor belt. This angered the scum bag of a customer behind me and he followed trying to pick a fight.This is not the fault of the store staff although the security staff today (6/5/24 at around 4.30pm) is an inhumane, inconsiderate being. My wife has been allowed to use the toilet on multiple occasions by the decent staff in the past who realise how pathetic it is for a store not to have a toilet.I realise you are cheaper than Tesco and Asda but can't you afford your customers some respect? Or must you strip them of their dignity in exchange for the cheaper prices ?Let me guess….. Ash will reply with something like “this will be passed to management to look at”We won’t be using your stores again and yes we can afford to buy our dignity.

Beware!I carried out shopping at Lidl in Hayes on following date.Lidl store.Location: Hayes, London borough of Hillingdon.Date:22.04.24I spent 1hr20mins shopping at Lidl with 30 mins queuing on top. I recieved a £90 penalty charge notice from Parkingeye stating I had exceeded their 90 min stay. I have several points to make here: (1) Tesco's have a 3 hour stay which allows you to browse longer resulting in greater sales! The 90 minute limit plus the extensive queuing time in Lidl suggest you should have maximum of 1 hour to shop before you got to think about queuing. This will result in shorter shopping time and fewer sales for Lidl.(2) If lidl had more people working the tills (there never more than one till open) the customer would be able to exit quicker.(3) There are no signs instore reminding customers that they have a time-limit on shopping! If there were customers would think of leaving the store sooner! (4) I have shopped with a trolley and have STILL been asked to use the express checkout and you know how difficult to imposible that is. I was told they do not have anyone available for any of the checkout till. This is unacceptable. Several days later I went instore asking for a manager and was told ""we're all manager""...lol. They advised there was nothing they could do about the parking notice ...what a joke!06.05.24- I emailed Lidl as requested, no response from Lidl.

Additionally, I noticed that some delicate vegetables like tomatoes and cucumbers were left outdoors despite the chilly spring weather, risking their health.When I asked if I could take some of the flowers that were destined for the bin, I was informed that Lidl’s policy prohibits giving away or discounting such items, even when they are clearly unsellable and bound for disposal.This policy not only contributes to unnecessary waste but also demonstrates a lack of consideration for both the environment and customer satisfaction. It’s disappointing to see a company prioritize rigid policies over practical solutions and customer goodwill.I urge Lidl to reconsider its policies regarding unsellable items, whether it’s offering them for free to customers who are willing to rescue them or providing discounts.

I regret I did not note his name.Having paid, I realised that my brother could not walk from where he was sitting near the Entrance door and go through a till and back to the Exit.   I asked Shift Manager, LEIGH, if he could possibly let us out through the Entrance door, which he immediately did, and was very gentle and humorous, supporting my brother on one arm while I was holding the other.  I asked Leigh to assist us off the premises, which he did, and, above and beyond the call of duty he continued to help support my brother to the car, and helped him into the front seat while I held the door open wide.   Leigh gently chatted us through all this, which helped my brother feel less embarrassed about having to ask for help.My brother and his 92 year old wife have always used Lidl in Ilford (High Road area), which is why I took him to my Alphington Exeter store today as a treat to be somewhere familiar, but his strength let him down when we entered the shop and we realised his legs could not do the distance around the aisles or the journey back through a till to the Exit door.The help we received was  EXCELLENT, EXEMPLARY, and so pleasantly given.   I congratulate LIDL on their Alphington, Exeter choice.ShirleyDate of experience: April 24, 2024",5

I gathered the cashier’s name as Sharon.We came with our bags that we purchased the previous week we just didnt remove the tags, we didnt know we were going to be attacked by her by not doing so.so when we were on the till she said i need to acan those I said no we purchased this previously;while i was still holding the bags on our cart she just grabbed it harsly saying no, not even lostening, not even asking for a receipt for them or trying to understand. She called someone who was also super useless. The person she called was a black person i didnt catch the name and he kept telling me to calm down/ “go outside “ “there are customers waiting” as if I am not a customer. I was trying to say what are you doing we bought this etc while no one was willing to listen and my son started panicking and crying because of sharon and his constantly trying to shut me and my husband up colluege until we asked for the manager and he arrived together woth 4 other security people.all of a sudden we looked like we are bandits middle of the store for some stupid bags. After 5 mins of caos finally someone listened and my husband showed the electronic receipt which i think it is also ridicolous who keeps the receipts from precious shopping?after showing sharon didnt even care to apologise, and you team treated this as a simple misunderstanding. On our end this is not simple at all.in fron of my child,in front of everyone there we were accused of something ridiculous and our bags was basically torned off from us.what is your store going to do about it?

It was a very pleasant shopping experience and felt a bit like shopping at Waitrose but with Lidl prices. Since it was built, a few years ago I have spent tens of thousands of pounds in there, but no more. Lidl got Parking Eye to install their dreaded cameras in the car park without my knowledge and I ended up with a £90 parking charge.I made a genuine mistake by overstaying the new strict maximum parking time and after spending so much money in there the £90 penalty felt unjustified for a genuine mistake. I sent an email to Lidl which was ignored and also went to see the local manager who said that there was nothing he could do.Fortunately there is an Aldi the same distance from my house that has no parking restrictions. I will now go there to spend my hard earned money. It's not such a nice shop as the Lidl was but at least I will be able to shop in peace with none of the stress or anxiety that shopping against the clock can involve.What a shame!Date of experience: April 02, 2024",1

I encourage you to review the facts and consider adjusting any inaccurate descriptions as this is a clear example of RACIAL BIAS and lack of knowledge about basic facts.For reference, here is some crucial information from the Internet to understand the difference:	◦	Poland’s geographical location places it in THE HEART of Europe, bordering Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, and Russia. 	◦	While historical contexts may have influenced different perceptions, acknowledging Poland as a CENTRAL EAUROPEAN nation is both accurate and respectful.Date of experience: January 25, 2024",1

They had a sign up which said “please leave your shopping trolleys at the door at your RISK” and when challenged the rude manager explained that unless I left it there I couldn’t go in. When asked if they were prepared to accept liability should it go missing they refused so effectively they are transferring their risk of possible theft onto every customer who enters their shop with a shopping trolley and not providing any assurance their belongings will be looked after and protected while they shop.

I am a regular Lidl customer and visit the Lidl Belvedere Clydesdale Way Branch for my main shop once or twice a week, usually spending an hour or more in there - & well over £100. Lately, there have usually been only a few trollies available at this branch (although plenty of far-too-large double buggy ones), & those that look ready to use are frequently unusable due to locked wheels - which staff seem not to be interested in and to do nothing about when told. On my most recent visit, in the afternoon of a Thursday in April 2024, there were no usable trolleys (where have they all gone?) and I had to negotiate to retrieve one from someone who was loading their car - which delayed me. I then did a big shop, browsed all the one-off bargains arrayed along the centre of the store, and spent a lot of money.I also had to make a return trip because I forgot something. This time, various items that should have been free or discounted because of coupons activated on my Lidl card account came up full price for unknown reason. Although store staff spent some time trying to assist, in the end they could not help and that caused even more delay. To add insult to injury, six days later I received a £90 parking fine for exceeding allowed parking time by just under ten minutes. It was issued via CCTV by Parking Eye - presumably on behalf of Lidl.Although not mentioned in Google ad, only 90 minutes  parking is allowed at this branch, which isn't really enough time for a big shop and the browsing that Lidl actively encourages - let alone the delays that Lidl itself caused on this occasion.TBF, this is a clean, pleasant store and staff are invariably nice. But they do often have empty shelves. And unless something is done about the insane parking fines as well as the other problems I will shop at Asda Belvedere  instead, where discounts are similar.I have reached out to customer services and will update here in event they are willing to do something.

I particularly want to thank the man who found my car keys and looked after them for me for over a week. I had no idea they were in Lidle but this man had picked them up and put them somewhere safe for me. I was at the point of having to replace the lot of them at a cost of well over £300 so I wanted to thank him for saving me so much money, time  and stress but he refused to take my little gift.

612,lidl,AFSullivan,GB,"Mar 29, 2024","Misleading Price ReductionsHaving spent well over £100 on my latest shop, I got around to having a quick look at the receipt a couple of days later. During my 'shop' there had been a high number of short dated items reduced. They had hand written orange labels and the cashier even commented the machine had broken down and agreed there were lots of bargains. All of the reduced items I purchased were labeled '30' or '60' and so I assumed they were 30p or 60p as one would. Coming up to the Easter weekend, I assumed they were trying to clear short dated stock ahead of new deliveries perhaps. I purchased 14 reduced items and the vast majority of my shopping was full price. When I later looked at the receipt all of the reduced items had only been reduced by 30% or 60% rather than charged at 30p or 60p thus I was over charged around £15.I was annoyed but thought if I sent evidence to their Customer Services then they would apologise and refund the money over charged.In short, after a number of emails back and for requesting photos, bar codes etc despite me sending plenty of evidence in the first email, they have refused to pay me anything as it is their 'store policy to reduce items by 30 or 60%'   This is clearly misleading pricing when items are labeled 30 or 60 - expecting the customer to guess that's a percentage reduction not a price. I am now reporting them to Trading Standards. I am not naming the store as it is my treatment by Customer Services that has been totally unsatisfactory. I have some sympathy that the person doing the labelling did not forsee the outcome.Also, obviously the speed with which they throw everything through the till makes it impossible to see, check or query any price discrepancies at the time.Date of experience: March 25, 2024",1

To day I was getting a few things I forgot from the day before.I cluding a bottle of gin.Going thru the till I went to the chip and pin as my 17 year old daughter helped put the shopping through. I am disabled.On entering the gin the girl on the till asked for ID. I explained it was for me. She then advised she needed ID from us both.I asked why as I am 58 and I was buying the gin. No explanation except kept asking for my daughters ID. She did not have any on her as not buying anything and I already said she was 17.I asked to speak to a manager.By this point I had 3 queues of people staring at me and my daughter. A man I thought was the manager came over and spoke to the young girl then another guy with a security man came over. By this point I was very intimidated. The manager introduced himself and began to tell me that the girl was well within her right to ask for ID. I explained that it was me who was buying and it was ridiculous to ask for my daughters ID. The manager was right in my face telling me I was rude. Still no reasonable explanation was given. I then was rude and told him to keep all his shopping.He told me I was banned from his store. I was fuming and angry. not by the girl but the manager who showed no managerial skills what so ever in diffusing this situation. In fact Shaun made it 100 times worse. He did give permission to use his name and was very smug when I said I would complain.As for being banned for the 1st time from a shop at  58 I am embarrassed but still can't understand why asking for daughters ID.  we go and buy the same thing week in  and week out never a problem.

She was very rude and abrupt, stating that ""they're the rules"". I mentioned that I had never been asked this before, and she again rudely barked that these were the rules.Reluctantly, I did as this extremely rude person ""ordered"". However, I always like to keep my trolley to my left hand side (where the card machine and Lidl Plus scanner are) as this is easier for my personal circumstances, and also it prevents impatient people from invading my personal space and privacy whilst I am packing my shopping or trying to pay with my debit card.This person then rudely stated, ""Especially when the cameras have you with other things in your trolley"". She then leaned forwards and looked into my trolley, asking, ""Have you got anything from here in there?""At this point, I became extremely angry, as this was an insult to my integrity / honesty, particularly as I am extremely honest and am also a regular customer of Lidl. (I will add here that I had my shopping bags in the trolley, which I was packing, and also a carrier bag which contained a couple of obvious personal items and lots of carrier bags for recycling in-store).It was clear that this person was accusing me of theft. I told her that I did not care what ""her cameras"" showed (as I had nothing to hide). At this point, the person in the queue behind me crept forward and was close to where I needed to insert my debit card, and this then prompted me to move my trolley back to where I preferred it to be.I also told this extremely horrible and rude person that this made my point (as to why I always keep my trolley there) and she mumbled something. I then paid, and was extremely angry, after being insulted and also embarrassed, as everyone had been looking at me because of her.I then left the store to take my shopping out of my trolley, and thought to check my receipt. I noted that she had charged me twice for one item. This was the final straw, so I re-entered the store, and the security guard was quite abrupt.I asked if I could see a manager. He came out quickly, and I told him what had happened. He stated that it was the policy that trolleys are on the right hand side of the customer when packing, and that ""there are people who check that"" they ""are doing that"". (However, I have never been asked to do this before, and neither have I noticed anyone else doing it, or being asked to do it).I made it clear that I was unhappy with the way in which the individual concerned had spoken to me, as there is a way of talking to people. However, he did not answer this, and was clearly disinterested in my comments, dealing only with the refund for the duplicated item.In all the time that I have been shopping at this store (since it opened) I have NEVER experienced this kind of rudeness before. I always have a nice and pleasant conversation with the staff, and most of them know me and speak to me as they pass me in the store.This vile person's accusing glare into the carrier bag recycling in my trolley (asking me if I had anything from the store in there) was extremely insulting, rude and degrading.As a result of this vile individual, I am currently weighing up a possible change of loyalty to an alternative supermarket. I have always enjoyed shopping at Lidl, chatting to the staff and using the Lidl app until that evening.I am so angry at this disgusting person's behaviour and attitude that I currently do not wish to set foot in there again. I am also considering contacting the local press and am also sharing my experience on here and social media, because the more I think about this, the more disgusted I am.For a loyal customer of Lidl to be treated like this is unacceptable. This rude and vile person either needs to change to an alternative career where she does not have to deal with customers, or be trained in people / customer service skills.If I do ever return to the store, I do hope that she is not operating the checkouts again, as I will be abandoning my trolley if she is the only member of staff available.Date of experience: March 08, 2024",5

He said absolutely not and turned away. The store was not busy, I was there on Monday after 11am. I find this to be bad customer care, and I question if they do not keep 1L bottles intentionally, so people are forced to buy the more expensive version.

The Aldi in Bromborough had the same issue and did exactly that and got rid of checkout tills for self service. I can understand it if you are doing a big shop, however if you only have a couple of items but have to stand in a long queue then it becomes a pain and people will go elsewhere.

On the upside the store is always clean well spaced out which make shopping more pleasurable, just need to get a better staff atmosphere and this store would be perfect.Date of experience: February 17, 2024",1
698,lidl,VJ,GB,"Feb 16, 2024","LIDL Voted Worst UK Retailer - by me.LIDL is no longer worth wasting a journey to do your shopping at. The level of frustration from long queues, broken self service machines and constant stock shortages means you are better off just going to a mainstream supermarket where you can easily get everything in one stop. LIDL did have a compelling argument several years ago, but especially since Covid, improving price and quality competition from other retailers has left them trailing. Farewell LIDL, you tried, but failed. Here's the straw that broke the camel's back, so to speak...In January, I bought a pack of rechargeable AA batteries for use in my cycle lights, but didn't try to use them until February. When I did, I discovered that they were too large and were such a tight fit, that it would be impossible to remove them for recharging, so I rushed back to LIDL and demonstrated the size difference with other batteries from several well known brands. The reason the LIDL batteries are oversized appears to be because they have been dressed up with a glittery paper(?) covering, in order to make them more appealing. In fact, the covering has already started to come off, after trying to fit them in my lights. LIDL agreed that they were larger than the Duracell and other batteries I brought in to demonstrate and agreed that they did not fit into the battery compartment I also brought in to demonstrate, but they were not interested in refunding me, 'Because it was more than 28 days since the sale - and that is the law,' or words to that effect. I explained that they were not applying the Consumer Rights Act 2015 correctly, but they were not interested.For the record, my rights are:0-30 days: You can claim a full refund for goods that are of unsatisfactory quality, unfit for purpose or not as described. 30 days-six months: You must give the retailer one opportunity to repair or replace it before you can claim a refund.Six months or longer: You must give the retailer one opportunity to repair or replace it before you can claim a partial refund, and the burden of proof is on you to prove the product is faulty.If you'd prefer a repair or replacement in the first 30 days you can ask the retailer, but it cannot refuse to give you a refund.The bottom line is, I will be giving LIDL a wide berth from now on. In any case, as mentioned above, I'm sick of the long queues, broken self service machines and constant stock issues - and unhelpful staff.Date of experience: February 15, 2024",1

The manager would not issue a refund because he said the card number on my receipt had to match my physical card. I pay with ApplePay, for security all ApplePay payments encrypt the card number and it is never the same as the physical card.He told me I had to write to customer services and ask them for a letter in the post approving the return. What is this, the dark ages?I emailed them, they took a few days to reply and to say the manager misinformed me and to go back to the store and get them to call customer services in case the store won't refund me.At the same time I needed to return another item, and a different customer service agent sent me a letter. I replied saying the same, no response for over a week.I emailed again and a different person replied saying they'd issued me a letter. No letter arrived. You have to wait 5 working days after them issuing a letter to follow it up/for them to resend the letter.Now it's past the return window and I'm stuck with a low quality steamer that I don't want and haven't been able to return because Lidl aren't up with the times.What a convoluted process, and it doesn't even work!!!Such a frustrating experience and I've never had an issue with any other companies returning things using ApplePay.Post pandemic, most people use their phones to pay now.

711,lidl,Olga,GB,"Feb 7, 2024","Cynical, hypocritical Lidl, lying Customer Services.Today, Lidl Blackbird Hill, Wembley, just added insult to previous injury.Back in October 2023, my local branch of Lidl suddenly introduced a policy of banning customers from bringing their Hoppa shopper trolleys into the store. Security stopped me at the entrance, said ""you have to leave your trolley outside. All the supermarkets are doing it now."" That last statement was a lie - still is. I haven't come across any other supermarket in my locality which prevented me from bringing in my empty Hoppa, and latching it to Lidl's own metal trolley, which are actually designed with a little shelf and hook where personal Hoppa's can be placed while shopping. I asked to speak to the store manager, who said that the levels of pildering in the store had gone through the roof, so they are now forced to ban all personal trolleys. I explained that I don't have a car, rely on public transport, and wouldn't be able to get my shopping home without it.  I asked, did they provide a secure place for the unattended Hoppa's - NO. Can I leave my Hoppa with one of the checkout assistants, so she could look after it - NO. The manager said, just leave it outside the tills, it's be OK.  I pointed out that if the levels of theft at the store had gone up that much, why were they so sure that my Hoppa would be secure whilst left unattended and unguarded. I asked will they guarantee that my Hoppa will still be there when I finished my shopping, the manager said No, no guarantees. I asked would they compensate me for the loss of my Hoppa if it was stolen and get me a taxi so I could get my shopping home? No. Yje manager said, you have to leave the Hoppa outside behind the tills at my own risk. I offered to show them that my Hoppa was empty on entering the store, and again on reaching the till, to show that it was still empty, and that I hadn't pilfered any of their merchandise, but the manager wasn't interested, said ""we don't have the time for that"". All my arguments that it would only take a few seconds to see that the Hoppa was completely empty, were to no avail.So, I had no choice - I went inside the store on my own, and had to leave my brother outside, attending our Hoppa, because we couldn't afford the horror of trying to get lots of loose good home without the Hoppa Trolley. This had a major impact on me - I'm a pensioner, have arthritis, COPD and the bending up and down while reaching for items and placing them in the trolley causes me a lot of pain. My brother, who helps me with shopping every time, couldn't help me, as he was outside, looking after our Hoppa. My brother, while physically relatively OK, has other issues (I'm his carer), so he couldn't do the shopping instead of me. After that first shop, I was in agony, and laid up for a couple of days after from all the exertion.So, when I got home, I contacted Lidl UK Customer services department, asking them if the banning og Hoppa's was really their policy, and did they make any provision for the elderly and disabled people who absolutely rely on their Hoppa's to do the shopping. The Customer Services initial response was surprise, from which I gathered that it wasn't a Head Office Lidl policy, but one implemented by the manager of the Blackbird Hill store, and some other store managers. I asked them if they would tell me which London Lidl stores didn't ban Hoppa trolleys, but they refused to tell me. They implied that the nearest store was a very long way away, well beyond my locality.In a genuine attempt to be helpful, I suggested ways in which Lidl stores could resolve the problem, without forcing all the risk of theft )of Hoppa shopper trolleys) onto their customers. I don't recall the full list, but here are some of the suggestions I made: a) introduce a rail behind the tills, so that the customers could chain their Hoppas to it with a bicycle chain, b) have a designated person guarding the trolleys and issuing numbered tickets for the Hoppa's so that the person would be sure to get their own trolley back, c) allow elderly and disabled, who don't have a car, and who rely on their Hoppa trolleys, to identify themselves using the London Freedom pass - which identifies pensioners and people with disabilities, and allow them to bring their Hoppa inside the storeon the condition that they show that the Hoppa is empty once they reach the checkouts. I made a number of other helpful suggestions, which would achieve the store's objective of reducing pilfering, but still allow people who desperately need their Hoppas to bring them in store, rather than unattended. None of my suggestions were welcome. Imagine my shock today at Lidl, when I saw Personal Shopper Trolleys on sale in Lidl. They are described as ""Practical shopping trolley"" and has a picture of two happy smiling grey haired pensioners using the trolley- BUT NOT IN LIDL - they're banned!

Never faced any issue in anything in any store. During the pandemic, from 2020 got stuck in Derby for few years and used to visit sometimes to Lidl, Southgate Retail Park, Normanton Rd, Derby DE23 6UQ. Very peculiar activities of a staff , named Harjinder (Spelling may be not accurate) there have been noticed for few years.Whenever I used to buy a bottle of alcohol, to open the lock of the bottle, he used to refuse to serve me. The option was to walk with him from self check-out place to lock-opening area and give the bottle in his hand to open for me. Otherwise to take the alcohol bottle from self  check-out desk, open lock and to return to self check-out place, he claimed money from me. That scenario continued few times. Few other times he whispered bad words before me, possibly towards me and another time he asked me if I was stealing the things.When the pandemic was almost over, I started going there wearing my normal suit, blazer, etc. and surprisingly he served me every time without saying a single thing. Can’t say it was racial or status oriented discrimination.One evening, an old man couldn’t scan a vegetable packet and was crying and shouting for help in the self check-out desk for more than 7-8 minutes. That staff was in the charge of the self check-out area and didn’t help the old man. It was an absolute abuse to an aged customer and senior citizen.One time, he was seen to pick up thing from the shelf of the superstore and putting inside his pocket. Not sure, if he was doing that as a part of his job or stealing something from his own superstore.No complaint about this guy, the Lidl Management to be blamed not to supervise and monitor the in-store activities and behaviour of their working staffs.Requesting Lidl management to scrutinize the CCTV footage of this guy’s in-store activities from 2020, if accessible and if possible, publicly publish the footage in the web.Please Note: This review is based on the experience in Lidl, Southgate Retail Park, Normanton Rd, Derby.

Unfortunately, as it was running out today? I decided because we were visiting in Hastings I would do my shop at the Hastings branch. I say unfortunately because the whole experience has left me feeling extremely unhappy and I truly wish I’d just not bothered about finding the local Lidl and forgone the £10 prize.When I returned to my vehicle & after packing the shopping away, I realised the £10 had not been taken off the bill. I had scanned my phone before shopping and if this was wrong then the till operator should have said, both my coupons were activated and as far as I was aware the amount comes off at the end of the shop. Yes, maybe I should have checked it at that point but previous prizes I’d won just went through as I shopped. Also, the till had a long queue and I was aware of others waiting behind me so I was trying not to delay others.If this was the only problem I encountered I’d just chastise myself for not being more careful but the treatment I received from the manager, who I asked politely if he could help and at this point I was unaware was the manager, was extremely unhelpful and in fact in my opinion offhand, unprofessional and very rude. He had no intention or interest in helping me and told me I should have checked at the till and that there was nothing more he could do. Which is fine if that’s true, it was my oversight and inexperience with using the Lidl apt that was at fault but if that man is a manager he needs retraining on respect and care of Lidl customers. As I said I was unaware that he was the manager until I asked if I could perhaps speak to one, his curt reply was “ that’s me, I’m the manager “ I think even he would have been able to read the shock on my face. Lesson learnt though on my behalf, Aldi may not have coupons and points to collect but I’ve never felt less than worthy shopping at Aldi. £10 off my shop swayed me to shop Lidl, never again!!Date of experience: January 27, 2024",1

Several visits, both early morning and late, to both stores in the run up to the big day failed to bag us a cheap bird. Not a sign of a even a feather in Lidl St Neots or Biggleswade and just 4 birds spotted in Aldi...and these were the much more expensive Norfolk Bronze variety.We too resorted to buying an alternative Xmas main event, didn't have much choice by that stage.

I’ve been using Lidl for 10+years, they have been fun and interesting to shop at, and gradually been my main shop. Admittedly my recent dietary requirements have meant I’ve had to split my shop, but as a whole I’ve been very happy with them. Also for most of this time I’ve always appreciated the fact the people on the till, go fast and are professional.This gradually has changed, accumulating in me experiencing a very upsetting incident concerning Misogyny to myself and an amount of toxic masculinity opinion forced on to my husband (at 58 and 62 we have seen pretty much most issues,btw) Understandably we recognised this to be a poor recruitment/singular incident, until we informed customer services. Lacklustre so far is the politest comment I can make. To me it seems the larger they get, the less they are sticking to their original ‘virtues’.Date of experience: December 30, 2023",4

My shopping is on the conveyor as I move my steel trolley through the cashier, Tegan advises me I have to move my trolley as I am blocking the fire exits (there are no floor markings, no signs – nothing!), she states in a very loud voice., “it’s the rules, I am just doing my job”. She then says I have to move my trolley and will not serve me as I am blocking the fire exits. I ask what fire exits? She calls the manager that now comes and moves my trolley out to 90 degrees from where it was and pushes it back in again – two inches back from where I had it. Tegan, the cashier shouts over to the manager “he hurt my back”, I guess she meant she twisted her back. After she rings my groceries, she snaps at me “cash or card” so I say what about please? Totally ignores me. I pay by card and she then says “You are not allowed to pack your trolley here”. From there I went to TESCO in Blairgowrie, I was met through the entrance door by a smiling lady dressed in Christmas hat giving customers a sweet as they entered. I am DISGUSTED by the way I was treated. This reflects further of the management tree of LIDLs. As an individual that spent many years in business development take it from me, carry on treating you customers with the Tegan attitude and you will reap. Totally disgusting. Your staff member should not be customer facing and your manager needs training how to apply management to make your customers feels safe and welcome in your stores. My only regret is that my son who was with me didn’t video this utter nazi behaviour. Update in response to LIDLS reply of “Sorry to hear this, Andrew. Please email with more information and we'll be more than happy to look into this for you. – Farrah” In response direct to Farrah – Dear Farrah, you seem to dilute the seriousness of this situation that your customers feel unsafe or welcome in your store. Please advise what further information it is that require? Your response lacks clarity, perhaps your response is your standard cut & paste response.

I confronted the manager about the price hike at the till and they said the cutterly set is an offer only with the Lidl Plus card . Wanting to take advantage of the offer I downloaded the Lidl Plus App from Google play store thinking it would take a moment and a quick affair.. WIFI was poor in the store and buffing lasted for 15 minutes to download the App  Once downloaded loads of questions to answer plus entering a code text to the App I had to ask to resend 3 times before it finally came through. Once set up I saw they were amazing deals and special offers throughout the week on some days free stuff given away. Had I the App before I could have saved 10% on my shopping then and long before and would had the App not been so poorly marketed by Lidl. Any how I have it now but not the shower gel which too was on offer and told at checkout can't be sold because it's been recalled.

Despite never written a review online before, this event left me feeling compelled to share. Words can't quite describe the hostile environment that is Okehampton Lidl. Despite the dirty aisles, and chaotic set up, it began well. But this was a very high standard in comparison to what followed next. As we began to pay, the manager came over to inform us, a group of adults, with one lady's 14 year old son, that we would in fact not be able to purchase any alcohol with our £200 weekly shop, full of vegetables and bread. They claimed that this was because she saw him pick up a bottle, and although we explained this was due to his suffering mother's back issues, there was no convincing. Due to their already understaffed workforce, this caused a great hold up for all other customers as we explained.It is hard to know whether the shoppers or the staff were worse. We were bombarded by rude and impatient other clients shouting at us, making us question why we even dared to enter the shop in the first place. This extended to the parking lot, as when we shakily unpacked our shopping, threatening men in cars were hurling abuse at us, as women tutted and murmured insults. Ironically, we were ultimately criminally served alcohol, as they embarrassingly forgot to flag up the 18 pack of beers that were later scanned through. This was hilariously the only part of the shop that the 14 year old was interested in drinking.So well done Lidl! Gold star for stopping a middle aged woman from buying a bottle of Pinot Noir, but letting a 14 year old get absolutely hammered!We appreciate there is little that could be done to prevent such unpleasant customers in your shop on this day, as we have never experienced an environment like that in a Lidl store like that before.

920,lidl,Francis Hippolite,GB,"Nov 4, 2023","ABUSE  AND APPALLING STAFF BEHAVIOUROn  1st November, I had a very embarrassing and humiliating experience with The Woolwich Lidl security staff . I  was leaving the store after purchasing items and was asked by a man to follow him to a room . I was a bit taken aback but not worried so got a shock when he suddenly asked me in a very aggressive manner to empty my bag. I  asked him why, and he said that I am a thief and that it's not the first time I stole from the store.  I  am a visitor to the UK, and I shop normally with my wife in this store at weekends since I have been here  and have never  imagine this could happen to me.  Not only was I accused of being a thief  in front of his 2 colleagues before he checked my items, but he shouted and swore  using very foul language to my surprise  .I asked his colleagues why he was being so aggressive, but they did not respond.  Whilst I understand that some retailers are being overwhelmed with thefts, the manner in which this was dealt with has left me traumatised and in fact I nearly  got into an accident  after leaving the store.   I tried to tell him he made an error and that he should  look at my receipts but he flatly refusing to say that that he has his own one .  Apparently  because I made a  second  trip back in the shop having forgotten to buy a few items  he assumed that my first purchased goods were stolen  without checking or  having any evidence of me putting things in my bag unpaid.    I managed to get one of the other staff to  look at my receipt and he confirmed to the aggressive colleague that my  items were paid for.  Rather than apologise for the error he further insulted me by saying that in future when I come to the store that I should hand my bag to him before I walk around .  I am not a thief , never have stolen in in my life  or never will.  This incident will stay with me forever and  can never ever return to the store except to get a  firm apology from the  staff in question .  I have provided a detailed description to a member of  the customer care team on the phone as was unable to access a manager of the Woolwich or  complaints team.I do not expect such a deplorable and unprofessional approach to handling such situations.  This has been the most upsetting and worst customer serviced ever witnessed and experienced and with no just cause or reason.  The disrespect was uncalled for let alone the  lie he stated of having seen me stealing before. . Why would he do such a thing causing such pain and insult.I am sorry,  but my wife and I will no longer shop at any Lidl again unless I get a full apology from this particular individual, or he is  reprimanded for his behaviour and actions - so unprofessional. I was not only embarrassed but humiliated despite the error or discrimination. or  simply  poor security serviceAs   I am expecting to travel shortly  I would very much appreciate a speedy response to this complaint in writing and have asked the company to respond within 5 days  with a full apology  and the recognition of the substandard service  delivered  to me.

It got thrown in the bin.On Friday, I purchased two Birchwood (grass fed) Ribeye steaks: they were tough, and not at all juicy. They tasted more like poor quality rump steaks. Birchwood products were once excellent, but I have found their quality seriously lacking recently.The Christmas range of German sweets and cakes have fallen in quality, e.g. there is hardly any marzipan in the cakes, and essential ingredients in several other items have been drastically reduced or adulterated.Lidl still continues with its practice of what appears to be the disappearance of items from the shelves only to be returned (after some time) with massive price increases, e.g. Mister Choc caramel bars: not long ago 65 p, but now £1.09! I could mention more items, but I think most people will get the point.It's time Lidl started exercising a bit of quality control and price control because I, for one, have started shopping for some of my foodstuff elsewhere.Lidl still sells good products; that's why I have given them 2 stars.

I did ask an assistant if we could use the ordinary tills, but was told that Lidl wanted everyone to use the self service tills!At our age, we are finding these tills very confusing. We are not quick enough at scanning the items before the voice shouts at us to scan or click finish. This gets us flustered and confused. Also the bending up and down to get items out of basket to scan and then to pack the bags after.

What difference does a slip of paper five microns thick make?Thing to remember is this, Lidl will not refund without a receipt, Lidl are not interested in credit card evidence, Lidl will not refund, even when they know you definitely bought a product from them, in this case one of their Parkside products, and finally, Lidl will ask you if you require a receipt, even though they know very well that you most certainly do need a receipt!P.S.

This is because they do not always put the orange ""reduced"" sticker over the barcode, and the staff member then scans the normal barcode.

The customer service was absolutely disgusting as was the cleanliness of the store. It smelled of rotten produce and the attitudes of the employees were just as bad. There were what appeared to be bullet holes from larger caliber weapons in the store itself as well and even that was more welcoming than my experience with the staff. Once I realized this was basically a generic Aldi’s I proceeded to try to leave the store. However, they lock you in and you need a receipt to exit. When I tried to exit I was stopped by an employee who told me I could not exit that way and needed to exit alongside the far wall. Sure, no problem, understand, happy to oblige. However, the aisle along the wall was roped off. So, I ducked under the rope and proceeded to leave only to be accosted by another cashier who basically chased me down in the store to check my backpack which I found quite embarrassing. As a tourist, I understand the disconnect in communication. However, general human interaction should be somewhat similar across cultures and there was no excuse for this type of behavior. If my French was up to its former level, I would have asked to speak to whomever I could in order to escalate this situation. Also, being approached from behind in the manner that I was, often leads to someone getting into a physical altercation out of protective nature. The individual who approached me is extremely lucky in this case that I was able to keep my cool because this type of behavior should not go unresolved, nor should I be put into a position of fight or flight. Never, and I repeat never make the same mistake while visiting abroad as I did in this instance. I am embarrassed and beyond annoyed at the experience I just had.Date of experience: September 29, 2023",1

There it might be tested to destruction before they can decided if it’s faulty and decide what to do in terms of replacement or refund.  This seems to be a very expensive way of dealing with a faulty relatively cheap item. It can only lead me to believe that it is done with a view to discouraging people to pursue their rights under consumer legislation. It does leave me without a kettle so I have to buy another.

I took one of these bottles back to the store for an exchange this morning. Even though Lidl has their own supplier of milk, the store insisted on me providing the original receipt. I showed them proof of purchase on my mobile baking app, but that wasn't good enough. The Deputy Manager, had zero concept of consumer law or business goodwill. He virtually accused me of trying to shop-lift a bottle of milk. He failed to social distance and was aggressive. He refused to provide the Store Manager's name.

I think these specific scones are the best on the market and much nicer than the Sainsbury's TTD scones(they used to be good around 1.3 decades ago, I know that much as this was my pregnancy craving whilst expecting my most precious bundle of joy, I was a geriatric mother that conceived naturally ie zero IVF etc. at 40 & most unexpectedly). I, personally wouldn't spend nor waste & fritter away vast amount of money on a English High Tea, I know myself well enough to know I'm bound to be disappointed(enough said there) yet quite happily purchase these again, especially if lucky to spot one with a 30% sticker, a Gr8 British Traditional Bargain treat right there! Couldn't help but notice how the serving suggestion is geared towards the Cornish Cream Tea Scones, does that mean that they're baked in Cornwall? I personally have preference for the Devonshire way! Ingredients : Wheat Flour, Buttermilk, butter, sugar, clotted cream, eggs, raising agents, salt (zero palm oil fat etc. yay). Also for future reference Lidl UK also do the same superb free from Palm Oil / Fat etc. 4 all butter scones under their Deluxe Brand Label at around the same price which I have personally sampled without the need of added conserve nor clotted cream(again, not needed as the loving craftsmanship comes through, naturally) but a nice cuppa Earl Grey or alternative.

Whilst checking out  a few items at ALDI, the checkout helper/? store detective walked over and asked to see the Warburtons Wholemeal Bread at the top of my other bag.  This other bag, including the bread, was with other groceries I had purchased from LIDL a few minutes earlier. Told her I have the receipt if she wishes to see it, but she was adamant and wanted to see the bread as she said ALDI has a similar item.  Therefore, I opened the bag and she said that's fine.  I put the bread at the top of my bag so it wouldn't squash.  Then mentioned to her, if I had put my bread towards the bottom of the bag she wouldn't have noticed it anyway. I do most of my shopping at LIDL and only go to ALDI for a few items.

Their prices are fair and sensible for good quality food, unlike the bigger supermarkets. However,  I am really disappointed that they have decided to have no delivery or click and collect service. I had operations last year and this year which rendered me unable to drive for a couple of months each time and had to revert to shopping in Tesco as I needed the delivery service. You're missing a trick there Aldi! Also can you get decent broadband in your shops please? My shopping list is on Alexa and I struggle to open it even when I'm logged in to your broadband.

90,Aldi,Mrs Euline Stewart,GB,"Oct 2, 2024","My shopping experience at my local…My shopping experience at my local Aldi's supermarket on Station Road, South Norwood, SE25 is extremely amazing in terms of 'affordable prices of various items.'  I would also say that the very good service given by staff at the tills are second to none; their friendly demeanour and willingness to help you at all times with any queries should be recognised. Another reason for writing this review is the fact that I've noticed several prices for many items are far better and lower than other supermarkets, for which I've visited. Great job Aldi and well done to you. Please keep up the good work!  Mrs Stewart.Date of experience: October 02, 2024",5

I have started using the Coleshill branch in Birmingham for the last 8-10 months with no issues. However today as I offloaded my grocery’s onto the conveyor belt and walked to the till with my reusable shopping bags the lady with blonde short hair asked myself and my husband to lift our bags up. At first I was perplexed then realised she was checking if we’d stolen any items. I queried why she asked, her response we always do. I noted that not only was it very poor and bad customer service to effectively accuse a customer of stealing when they are clearly at a checkout to pay but it was highly offensive. I am a black women my husband is white. We both noted the customers before us we’re not asked to do the same. This is shameful service on ALDI’s behalf and we have never been subjected to this offensive behaviour by a member of staff before. I will now be sharing this with as many people as possible to highlight what exactly is good on and what people are being targeted. Shame on you ALDI train your staff better if you want to stay in business as customer service is just as important as cheap prices and quality of food.Date of experience: October 21, 2024",2

The employee on the conveyor belt smugly said, ""Well, there's a reason you come to Aldi, isn’t there?"" Her tone made it clear she thought I was only there for the cheap prices, implying that with budget products, I should expect rude service. I was fuming! I explained that the only reason I shop there is because it's the closest big grocery store to me, and if I had another choice, I wouldn’t bother. Her cheeky response? ""We don't force you to come here.""It feels like this attitude comes from higher up, as if Aldi’s saying, “Want cheap shopping?

I don't usually do this but was thinking that almost £80 of a shop was above what I ever spend on my weekly shop. I instantly notice that I had been charged for 3 x 6 packs of juice when only had 2. I proceeded back to the store and eventually received a refund for the extra item charged for. I was advised that it was a new staff member in training. I went back to my car and again looked at my receipt. I then noticed I had been charged for multiple extra items throughout my receipt! Where I was charged for 6 bottles of sparkling water, the assistant had scanned 1 bottle and charged for 6 then scanned the other 5 individually that she had already counted for! 2 packs of biscuits and charged for 3 etc etc. I eventually got all of this sorted out but was made to be a pain by the staff! Also when I returned into the store a second time, the staff member on the checkout was still clearly serving 10 minutes after I had initially made the manager aware of the problem! The is a clear attempt of contemptuous activity in my opinion! I called the customer services centre to report my experience. To add insult to injury they just shrugged their shoulders!

At first, I only bought a few things, but now most of the food is tasty and seemd good quality.  Shame the cat food is not!  My cat will not eat any of their flavours in the sachets or the foiled packs.  This is extremely unusual because my cat will usually eat anything!  I can only presume it is disgusting and must be contaminated or harmful to them and they sense it.  DO NOT BUY THEIR CAT FOOD!!  Profit must mean more to Aldi than quality, which makes me rethink about buying any of their food!Date of experience: September 30, 2024",1

I had put a single orange pepper in my basket, when I came to pay, as it had no barcode I hit the ""look up item' tab. The relevant item appeared but when I pressed it nothing happened so the girl who was overseeing the srlelf-service checkouts came over and informed me that I could not purchase the item, I could either purchase a single red pepper or a pack of three mixed. As I didn't want either, I ended up having to go elsewhere just for a pepper. The incident was so irritating, got the impression that this jobsworth control freak derived great satisfaction from annoying a customer. If they can't sell an item individually then why have it on the checkout display screen? Perhaps they did once but someone in their misguided wisdom decided against it. What happened to customer satisfaction and an enjoyable shopping experience? Aldi must spend millions in advertising revenue then annoy (an ex-loyal customer) off for the sake of a 50p pepper, and what would have happened to it-went the bin I expect,pathetic!

Unfortunately, I had forgotten my PIN at that moment. As I had access to my bank app, I stepped out to retrieve my PIN, but the mobile network was poor, delaying the process. I informed the staff member at the checkout of my situation, and he allowed me to step outside.However, upon returning, I found that my groceries had been cleared to serve the next customer. While I understand the need to keep the line moving, what happened next was completely unacceptable. I apologized for the delay, only for the staff member to rudely respond, saying, “It’s okay because I’m sick in the head and forget my PIN.”I have been a regular customer at this location for the past year and have never encountered such disrespect. Forgetting a PIN is a common occurrence, and it is unacceptable to be treated in such a demeaning manner. I trust Aldi will look into this matter seriously to ensure such behavior does not become a recurring issue.Thank you for your attention to this matter. I hope to continue shopping at Aldi with the assurance that your customers will be treated with respect.Kind regardsDate of experience: October 01, 2024",1
159,Aldi,Don Hill,GB,"Sep 19, 2024","Self checkout tills are ruining AldiSelf checkout tills are ruining Aldi. Why ever they decided to install them just at the time when other supermarkets had realised they were not such a good idea is beyond me.Thursday morning, reasonably busy at the Birdwell branch, there was only one manned checkout operating, with a queue of six customers with large trolleys waiting. I took my few items to the self service - it never works smoothly for me, I swear it sees me coming - as expected and in spite of being very careful what I did, I got the machine continually telling me to wait for an assistant, who had to come at least three times, pressed what was required all without either speaking or looking at me. The tactics are obvious - cut down on staff, make customers do the work and we get more profit. In my opinion Aldi has never been the wonder store that it’s cracked up to be. There are a few items I like, but many of their products, particularly fresh fruit and veg, are of poor quality.Aldi is my nearest supermarket, so it’s convenient, but I’m lucky in that there are many more choices not much further away, all with a better level of staffing.

179,Aldi,M M,GB,"Sep 14, 2024","Stanier Retail Park Aldi, KetteringI am writing to complain about the very poor customer service.Let me start off by saying I  have been a loyal Aldi customer for over 5 years now. I conduct my grocery shops at Aldi twice a week, every week. But I have never been so annoyed as I have been today.At 7.30pm today I was shopping at the Aldi Store at the Stanier Retail Park in Kettering, well before closing time and I was coming by to pay at till 1, where the green light above the till was still there and there were customers using it. Just as I got there, the till lady told me to go to the self checkout, even though the till was still open. I had a very full trolley and she had definitely seen this and yet she still told me to use the self checkouts in a very rude manner that had other customers frowning at her tone and looking around.I had always used the salesperson assisted tills until this point as  but there was absolutely NO SPACE AT ALL for my groceries. All my soft pastries, cakes and bread loaves got completely crushed and nearly half a dozen of my eggs got cracked (and they were perfectly fine before as I had checked when I got them). This is simply not acceptable, there is nowhere near enough space for a full weeks worth of grocery shopping to be scanned at a self checkout, all it leads to is damaged items, not to mention how hard everything is to put back into the trolley afterwards with what little room there is at the self checkout.The woman at the till definitely could have scanned my shopping, but she chose not to, knowing full well that I couldn't scan all of that at the self checkout.This is neither  proper nor appropriate behavior that is expected of a salesperson.If I had known this was the treatment I would be exposed to I would never have wasted my time, or my hard earned money in this ridiculous institution. If it weren't for the fact that I am a decent, polite human being, I would have left right there and then and left my shopping in the trolley. But I did not, because , I do not delight in inconveniencing people.If they had at least put out a sign saying that only the self-checkouts were being used, then that would have saved me from wasting my time and I never would have come in and been inconvenienced like this.I then tried to contact Aldi via both the customer service email addresses listed on their website.

Infact I felt like she’s calling me a fraud by asking me where’s the package yet I had a receipt and I felt that if anything she would have asked me never to go back to Aldi. Yes I had complained about the same product then it kind of God better then for the past few months and I got courage to complain again about the same product thinking my voice mighty make make a better quality product again but I felt so hurt she forced me to bring out my rosary to prove to her that I am not a fraud I am a child of God and it’s a customer right and for the good of the supermarket. Last week Wednesday I bought avocados which within days normally should be able to consume but much has been ending up in the bin. So I picked the courage to go talk about it with the manager who also hardly wanted to listen to me or my idea as Aldi customer in chalton for years, Luck of customer care and rudeness is order of the day in that Charlton supermarket which is really a shame.

On getting home we only had the battery, so immediately returned to the shop to be told they didn’t have any chargers.Spoke to the manager as we couldn’t use the blower, he confirmed no chargers, there were some at Westbury 20 miles away, after some harsh word, he said he would go and get one …one had been put aside for him to collect.and he’d give me a call, 4 days passed ,no call, and it’s impossible to call the store ,checked this with customer service, so had to returned to the store, apparently he was without a car, I’d have to wait as there was no way of getting it to the Shepton store. He hadn’t rang me to keep me informed. Just wait or go to Argos I was told. So today 9 days later and no contact we travel the 40 miles to collect my charger, manager had on idea that they were keeping one. I consider my treatment was really bad, non trustworthy, words were spoken but didn’t mean a thing. Westbury manager Chis was very helpful, I asked for a discount but he said it would be a lost to his store, I suggested he took it up this the Shepton store, I eventually gave me 30% discount.I’ve learnt that Aldi couldn’t give a toss about customer service.

209,Aldi,lrw,GB,"Sep 3, 2024","Found a dead cockroach/cricket in tine of Aldi Tuna - Aldi took 2 months to follow up what could have been a serious food safety concernIn June 2024, my daughter opened a can of Aldi tuna in spring water and found an insect looking like a cockroach in the tuna. This was extremely distressing for her and Aldi's response has been, in my view, lazy, dismissive and disinterested. I have now written to Aldi's senior management team (see below). They have not responded but 'customer care' state that if I won't accept their £40 in store voucher 'compensation' then they will close my case with no further action. This compensation offer is not proportionate to the horrible impact of finding a dead creature in your tuna but more important than our personal experience, I am utterly disgusted that Aldi seemed disinterested in even checking what this insect was or where it came from (even though Aldi Australia have a 'trace your tuna' guarantee!).This is the email I sent to Aldi senior management and media relations:""I am writing to alert you to an issue of considerable concern with your company in the UK. I appreciate this is a different nation but I am about to go public with my concern and it is relevant to your sustainable and traceable seafood policy (which may be in force globally). In June 2024, my daughter found a whole insect which strongly resembles a cockroach in a tin of tuna. We have clear photos of this. The tuna in spring water was packed in Madagascar. I was extremely concerned from a public health view as it seemed highly unlikely that a packing plant in an economically challenged country would have only one insect in the packing process. I reported this instantly on the relevant page of the store website and followed up with emails. Aldi's response (for a brand who advertise 'trace your Tuna!) was appalling. We had to chase them for 2 weeks to get any form of willingness to examine the product and insect (which my husband froze  together with packing and product). We were then sent and envelope with which to send the tuna, can and insect through the normal post (where it would have disintegrated). Aldi refused to send a courier to collect and it seemed that the company were hoping we would give up or the product would be lost or damaged in the post and so could be forgotten about. Eventually my husband was made to do a 30 mile round trip in the car to deliver the item to his local branch where the manager said she would keep it frozen  and get it couriered to head office for investigation. It has taken more than 2 months for this 'investigation' to take place and we had a 'without liability'  email from a customer service advising the insect was a 'house cricket', extremely rare to find it, won't happen again and offered my daughter (who found it) £40 in store voucher for her distress.I have travelled extensively in Asia and seen the conditions which economically challenged countries have to work in (including tuna processing for fresh fish)  - incredibly low wages, no access to protective clothing, hygiene standards which would in no way meet UK or Australia or European standards and this has made me extremely concerned and keen to publicise this issue to the media and public. I am going to suggest that as well as your Tuna tracing service, Aldi publish pictures of the canning plants for this product, details of wages provided to the staff and products used to keep the plants clean and manage insects (products which could well be toxic). Packing plants that pack Tuna in 'spring water' in countries that have major water safety issues and shortages have to obtain their packing water somewhere - how does this happen without negative impact on the country or the water quality? It is entirely ridiculous to suggest the insect in my daughter's tuna can was a one off and I assume Aldi have these kinds of complaints regularly and try and buy off members of the public with extremely meagre offers of in store vouchers. I will be sharing this view with Aldi in the UK and Europe and with the media in relevant countries as it is vital that global companies are accountable for their practices and I am sure many members of the public would welcome seeing pictures of canning plants in economically challenged countries - both for meat and fish - and knowing what workers are paid and how they and they product are protected and how European/Australian and NZ and UK hygiene standards are met. If you are selling products at western prices then you have to meet western production and food safety standards.""Date of experience: June 19, 2024",1

At one store a manager made an attempt, without requesting, to search my bag. Aldi ended up having to pay me compensation for this gross error. A year later, my next visit at the same store, I declined a request for my empty bag to be searched, and I abandoned the shopping trip. The result was that I left the store without my bag having been examined. The Aldi protocol was revealed in this case as having been a  crudely authoritarian gambit, a power play attempting to cow customers. If the assembled store staff and manager had a real suspicion of theft, they could have practised a citizen's arrest and called the police. They did not. I simply left the store with my bag unsearched.The authoritarian ambition of the Aldi manager was further revealed when the manager became petty over not wanting promptly to return my shopping trolley token.

230,Aldi,Leppard,GB,"Aug 24, 2024","Frightening, intimmadating customer experienceIf you sometimes feel even slightly clausterphobic, you will want to avoid Aldi in Leamington Spa if you value your sanity. They already had a store while building a new one right next to it. Everyone was hoping the new store would be larger, spacious and more accommodating as well as having a more consistent and practical variety. The community were to be seriously disappointed. The new store was exactly the same and nothing had changed at all. Aldi still had the huge oversized shopping trolley's that are clearly not suitable for the size of the store and obviously cannot accommodate customers. It is like trying to navigate around tanks in a garage. Every weekend, I see tempers frayed by frustrated customers arguing with each other due to being trapped and coralled into pens by these huge tanks and there is no escape because the aisles are constantly barricaded by enormous crates and staff blocking access to shelves, forcing customers to turn around and navigate in another direction, only to find tanks and crates barricading the other aisle too.If you bought something you like from Aldi, don't get too fond of it, because it won't be there the following week. Aldi have always had serious issues with stock control. It is always inconsistent and the fridges and shelves are all too often bare and empty.Forget about customer services. Customers and the community as a whole have complained to Aldi head office about their cattle market, but they just ignore it and fobb you off to the regional managers, who aren't even remotely interested in customers.It is apparent that Aldi as a business have a contemptuous attitude toward customers. As long as they achieve their profits, they don't care. This is evident by the huge oversized trolley's, with the aim of encouraging customers to buy more and cause lengthy queues and inconvenience other customers, who Aldi are gesturing the finger to.I'm glad I have now abandoned Aldi and don't mind paying more doing my weekly shopping elsewhere for a much more comfortable, reliable, customer friendly and generally better customer experience.

The label says pack of five. Their own website says ""5 Pack"". Opened the pack which contained only four items. Would've returned to store but by this time I was thirty minutes walk away.2. Visited Aldi the next day. Selected the same item and carefully looked through the clear plastic packaging - only four items again. After an over-long period to actually get their attention, spoke to a member of staff who a) snatched the item from me, and b) said - with a smirk - ""can you not read? The packaging says approximately 5 items!""I decided to not buy the item, and will not do so in future. This will not be read by Aldi, there is no customer service to contact, there are no replies from them here on Trustpilot, but I will say this...If a label clearly states a pack of five, there should be five inside. Not four. Not ""approximately"" five. Anything less than five items in a five-pack is dishonest, false advertising, and a clear case of food fraud.Date of experience: August 22, 2024",1

The young person on the self service check out tills requires some in depth training on how to conduct himself while under employment. I was the only person using the tills at the time 12.20pm 22/08/2024 after a minute or so I had to interrupt the lad who was in some comical conversation with a 'pal'. After eventually getting his attention he went off to get the bag but was again distracted by a colleague who got chatting to him. In the meantime I'm stood about like a spare part so asked him to hurry up. He then proceeded to tell me not to talk to him like that and he had other things to do other than to see to me??? couldn't actually see what that would be other than idle chat with other people.  He then proceeded to tell me he could ask me to leave if he wanted and I had no right to confront him in that manner. I subsequently left what I was doing and left the store without my purchases. Another customer intervened and told the laddie how rude and abusive he had  been towards me. I will never set food in Aldis store again until this individual is removed from employment.  If this is Aldi's approach to customer service its a pretty poor show! The lad is extremely lucky I didn't call the police to deal with him - it was complete an utter verbal abuse aimed at a customer who was merely hurrying him along to do the job I'm assuming he is paid to do.  HE HAD NO GROUNDS TO ASK ME TO LEAVE THE STORE OTHER THAN BOOST HIS OWN SELF IMPORTANCE AND SELF ENTITLMENT.Date of experience: August 22, 2024",1

Thank you.My issue however, is with the ""out of order"" customer toilets in this branch. Would you please rectify this and treat as urgent. On the face of it, it may not seem an important issue to Aldi; but when you sit down and consider that you have customers attending who could be pregnant, or could have IBD (inflammatory bowel disease), or a myriad of other disabilities, hopefully, the ""human factor"" should kick-in and you would be able to empathise with those particular customers! If you are unsure of how you would feel with Crohn's/Colitis medical condition for example, then experiment for yourself i.e. the next time you get an urgent need to go for a ""poo"", say to yourself ""but I have nowhere to go!"" ... what would you do? What could you do? What would inevitably happen?! Correct! You would soil yourself. And there's no dignity in that! This may not be something you want to think about or visualise happening to you; but how else will you be able to empathise unless you can try to genuinely imagine someone else's dilemma? This is just one example. A pregnant lady would also face her own difficulties. As would people with other disabilities.

How about having a cancelation window that is before the customer sets off to pick up - let said customer know in advance, maybe a text message, email, semaphore or carrier pigeon? How about re-evaluating said partnership with possible brand damaging charlatans? How about going back to what you do best in stock high, sell low?

This is not widespread but occurs often enough to ruin the store's overall impression.*Quality control in the warehouse is lacking. When shopping, I often find moldy fruit, and the staff, from assistants to store managers, seem indifferent. This should result in a solid fine as it is a threat to human health. This issue has persisted in every store I’ve visited over the past decade.*Missing price cards are a constant problem. Despite having only 150-200 products per store, many price cards are frequently missing, and the introduction of new digital price badges has not resolved this issue.I wish I could say tolerating those faults is okay, but seeing how Aldi has not improved over the years with the same issues suggests they don't care and don't deserve a second chance. If there were a better convenient alternative, I would not set foot in their stores again.Date of experience: July 22, 2024",2

At one time my husband didnt know & ate the product & had food poisoning.

I told her that I need to walk 45 mins as I don't have car & I couldn't keep this containmenated products until I visited Aldi.  Not very helpful & lousy attitude.  Better shopped at Lidl.

311,Aldi,jonpspencer,GB,"Jul 23, 2024","Appalling experience from Aldi, Hertford. Following a shopping visit to Aldi, Hertford both my wife & I were treated like criminals with rude and aggressive behaviour by the checkout staff & a manager who failed to deal with the situation fairly or effectively. It started when my wife & I arrived at the checkout(I'm a retired Customer Service Manager for Robert Bosch Ltd and previously a Store Manager at Black & Decker & my wife who is a Cancer Nurse Specialist with 43yrs service. I have UK & European training in Customer Service, Business Management & Psychology having some 25yrs experience.When we arrived at the checkout the Checkout Operator grabbed our bags that were open in the trolley and & said I'm only looking for hidden items that have not been paid for 'my lovely'! We were shocked that we were being treated like criminals & thieves plus being addressed in a rude manner. Being annoyed at the affront to our honesty & integrity, I asked ""not to be called 'my lovely'"" as I didn't feel lovely after the lady accosting us in such a nasty & Ill mannered way. The lady then started pushing our goods through at me with excessive force, obviously now taking it out on our shopping! I requested that she stop immediately & that I wanted to speak with the manager as we were not being spoken to, or treated in such an appalling manner. I was equally surprised when she said a firm ""No"" to my request to speak to her with a manager, she again said no, so I stopped loading our shopping & again requested to speak with a manager. A lady that I presume was a supervisor appeared & I started to again request the manager & with that the checkout operator took back off the counter all the items that had been put through the till & mixed them up with all the items waiting to be put through the till all with excessive sounds & movements to make it clear she was not happy with us. A manager finally arrived & he listened to what I explained had happened & stated that can't be true as I know this person & she is not like that. When I said how can you say that when you were not here? He then accused us of being aggressive & uncooperative. Because he had raised his voice to me I said it's you who are being uncooperative & you have sided with your staff & are not protecting us from a rude & aggressive member of staff who you happen to know. If he could not answer or accept that we were treated unfairly, he would say your raising your voice or your being aggressive, to which I replied I'm only explaining truthfully what happened! For everything we said he was going to have an answer that it could not possibly be the checkout operators fault or her poor customer care skills.Obviously our complaint was not being addressed & neither was it likely to be resolved to our satisfaction. We felt at any moment we were going to be asked to leave(thrown out) through no fault of our own. Messrs Aldi from our experience were exceptionally bad at handling the situation, however, they do know their own staff & what they would or would not do even from the Managers Office! There was a day where the customer was treated with respect rather than being treated as an argumentative thieving customer! I'm aware of the variation of customers but you do not paint them all as being thieves, you should always treat them with the respect & dignity they deserve as it is us the customer who comes to your store that pays your wages. I detest being called ""My Lovely"" it was such a distasteful experience that I will now reduce using Aldi as the shopping experience is not something that my wife and I want to go through again. As professional people with excellent interpersonal skills & professional management training it might be something that Aldi would like to improve upon, from management down, rather than blindly jumping to the defence of your staff!

They need a re think in everything they do.The special buys generally are not that special anymore. What there is certainly isn't as good in quality nor as plentiful in supply as previous years offerings pre the Covid pandemic times. There's much smaller ranges, choices and overall value. A good example of this is the shrunk down camping and outdoors ranges offered these days. Lots of food lines that were good like the tinned meals like curry etc are missing in action. Gone, no more to be found in stores. The Cost of Living Crisis and constant regular bag searches have robbed it of being a joyful place to enjoy shopping in. For those of us who aren't actually store thieves.Foods supply seems to still be reduced from what it was a few years ago in numerous instances like bananas supply in my local store. The staff admit they don't see the volume of delivery they used to see in past years. I have to often venture into store a few times to even be lucky to get the bananas basic bag I want. Third time lucky again yesterday to find some. Some special buy lines often never materislise in store like the recent DIY tapes sets. My local branch is the East Grinstead store.I buy my regular normal everyday lines week in and week out. The price rises of basic lines has been relentless. On a plus note I like a lot of the staff, find them overall helpful.I miss the great Aldi of past years pre Covid that was so much fun to shop in and full of nice surprises and bargains.

The piece of pork was seriously fatty with more fat than I would have expected. There was also a extremely large amount of what can only be described as black meat when cooked and this put me off it. Aldis put their pork meat in plastic bags which is clear on the top but blue underneath which means all you can see is the rind and none of the meat. How they can charge £5.49 for this beggars belief. I will not be buying that again. I would warn everyone to be wary of buying this pork shoulder, save your money.Date of experience: July 06, 2024",1

Not to mention the lack of staffed checkouts.Back to Aldi. A year or so ago I think it was they installed four self checkouts in my local store, Basingstoke. I asked at the time if Aldi were going to go down the road of poor customer service as Asda has done and was told no. Over the past year they have installed more self checkouts.Did a quick shop last Thursday around 5.30 and only had a basket. Went to checkout and 1 staffed aisle was in operation with queue's backing up on that and there were 5 people in front of me at the self scanners, some of which were not working. There was one male member of staff frantically running round like a lunatic trying to keep up with the automated customer assistant required messages you could hear from most of the self scanners. It was chaos. 1 staff member at such a busy period and 1 staffed checkout open.It is so clear to see why the general public are getting so pissed off with supermarkets these days as they constantly put profit before customer service.ALDI...if you want to keep my custom you need to do better much better.

Nothing!I went in to the store and spoke to the manager, 3 times, and promissed a call from the regional manager. Nothing!I went straight back to the store after my latest purchase, with the potatoes and photos. Spoke to a sales assistant as the manager wasn't in. We checked all the loose potatoes and virtually all of them were mouldy, wrinkled, soft or green. Inedible all of them. He agreed they were dreadful. I got my money back but nothing for the 40 minute round trip. Apparently the manager I spoke to was sacked, as was the regional manager.

Older gent ushered me forward and wouldn't take no for an answer and only had a few items so he wouldn't be waiting for more than a moment.But no...

435,Aldi,Jaqen,GB,"Updated Sep 10, 2024","I am writing to bring to your attention…I am writing to bring to your attention an incident that occurred at your broad gauge way store on May 16th.While shopping, i encountered an unpleasant situation at the checkout. An announcement was made to open till 4, so i moved there from till 5, allowing a couple to go ahead as i had only a few items. However, the man insisted that i go first owing to the few items i have. I placed my items on the conveyor belt, the man suddenly raised his voice, ‘you didn’t say thanks’, and began using vulgar language and insults. To avoid further conflict, i left till 4 and returned to till 5, but he continued his verbal abuse aloud “he’s gonna get beaten up.” His aggressive behaviour was alarming, inappropriate, typically associated with heath town and is standard frequent practice for his low life sort to initiate unprovoked fights. I am perplexed as to why a thank you was demanded from me in this context. I came to the store to shop, whereas this uneducated individual seemed intent on searching for a fight. His warped upbringing apparently taught him that violence is an appropriate response when someone doesn't comply with his expectations and has no quark of what being rude or manners are as in his warped definition, i have no manners and am rude. He displayed no understanding of manners or civility and believes that his aggressive behaviour would impress females of his lowest level. If CCTV footage is reviewed, you will see that i initially let them go first. Despite this, the subsequent cold reception from some staff members suggests they have wrongly assumed i was at fault, which reflects on their intelligence, but more than likely have a preference for dense uneducated men. This is disappointing, especially as i have shopped at your store for two years previously without incident, which should reflect on my character.The Asian security guard acted swiftly to control the situation, demonstrating commendable intelligence which is rare for a security guard. In contrast, the black security guard's intelligence and standard security guard features resembles that of a lifetime convict, which unfortunately seems to be a stereotype associated with security personnel.‘Oh my God, he didn’t say thanks! What an offensive man! He’s a criminal! Disgusting! Never seen anything like it! It’s the end of the world! It’s the end of humanity! It’s the end of life! i can’t believe it! What are we gonna do? err dunno, should we get stoned? We’re doomed! God please save us! mommmmmmmyyyyyy, arrrrrrrrgggggggghhhhhhhhhh!’Seriously? You need urgent psychiatric help...My intention is not to escalate the situation but to clear up any misunderstandings regarding my conduct.Date of experience: May 16, 2024",1
436,Aldi,Chris,GB,"May 28, 2024","Water added to Smoked Salmon Bought the 200g Smoked salmon from the Enfield store.Upon opening the pack I could see that there was a large quantity of water inside.This is cleverly placed behind a plastic sheet, to keep it off the salmon itself. The plastic sheet is covered in indentations / pimples to increase its surface area so that it holds much more water.I would estimate that the water added to the packaging makes up at least 25 percent of the total weight.It is disgusting that they are deceiving customers in this way and charging them for water instead of salmon.I messaged Aldi customer services, and I got nothing more than a standard response saying they will refer it to the relevant team for review, and was told to return any product to the store for a refund if I was not happy with it.They refused to say why the plastic sheet holding water is inside the packs, and refused to let me have a response from the ""relevant team"".It is quite obvious why they put a plastic sheet holding water in the packs. They are the ""cheapest supermarket"" for a reason. They are ripping off customers with cheap tricks and deceiving them.Clearly, you get what you pay for.Date of experience: May 23, 2024",1

445,Aldi,Fifi GS,GB,"May 26, 2024","Racial profiling at Aldi Selsdon is…Racial profiling at Aldi Selsdon is appalling. I understand the rate of shoplifting being reported daily however targeting blacks only and leaving other races is clear discrimination. I was asked to tip over empty bags including the ones that were folded, yet the white customer who had just been saved in front of me wasn't asked to do the same. Other customers from two other tills who were not blacks and had bags in their trolleys were never asked to tip over their bags. When I asked the female cashier why I had to do that and if she suspected me of theft and why she didn't ask the other customer she had just served. She defended herself said the other customer didn't have any bags yet they had bags and a buggy with a basket below. She told me it's a company policy to search bags but if this policy is targeting the minority only it's very unfair and discriminatory When I challenged her, the cashier began raising her voice and ended up calling the manager and refused to serve which, I've no regrets. The manager told me the same thing that it's company policy even when I told him that she checked the bags again for the groceries she had put through the till that I had bagged! When I left the shop the manager was laughing with other customers who he served after me and his behaviour was clear to me that this is not just an Aldi's policy but pure racism. A policy should be applied to all customers. If bags have to be tipped over, then ask or make an announcement asking all shoppers to tip over their bags before bagging groceries and everyone will know it's now company's policy. Some shops like Sainsbury's have gates at some of their stores where one has to use a receipt to exit, that's a policy which targets all shoppers not a particular race. Having shopped at Aldi Selsdon for over 10 years I will never shop at any Aldi ever again! Asking certain shoppers to tip over their bags with no evidence at all of stealing is bad for the business. Have one policy for all.Date of experience: May 25, 2024",1
446,Aldi,A.L,GB,"Updated May 26, 2024","My dyslexic father was abused and screamed at. My dyslexic father was abused and screamed at in the west malling branch this evening, for a mistake he made due to being unable to read or write. He was not aware vapes were not allowed in stores, and could not read any of the signs, so instead of the manager kindly coming up to us and saying ""Hi guys, sorry but no vapes allowed in stores please"" - he proceeded to run up to us with a cruel and aggressive tone of voice, spoke to us like criminals and called my dyslexic father ""sick"" for ""breaking the law"". He wouldn't let neither me or my father talk, although he decided to speak in such an aggressive and dismissive tone and provoked us, walking away. I kindly asked him, as a manager, to please listen to us as customers, that my father is dyslexic, that we would never break any store policy or law intentionally to which he again, said he isn't ""stupid enough to believe that"" and call us liars. Again, aggressive in tone, getting in close proximity to our faces. I literally begged this man, calmly, to please believe that we would never do something like that knowingly, that my father is dyslexic and cannot read or write, so isn't aware of generally new laws and this man, twice my size, was treating me, a woman with mental illness, like vermin. He was being aggressive in tone, in mannerism, in body language. Mocking us, demeaning us, belittling us, refusing to believe me, speaking to me which such aggression that my father became really upset, stepped up to him and told him to never speak to any woman or person like that because it was so abusive. Again, the male manager walked off, claiming he had called the police for defending ourselves. Female staff members stood around, watching this male manager embarrass me in front of customers, be aggressive and shout at me and my father, one of them even looking at me, a fellow woman, like I should be ashamed of myself or like I was the one in the wrong, berating us for ""shouting around kids"" when the male manager had literally been aggressive and shouting at us in front of kids. Not one staff members stepped in to de-escalate the situation or to tell the male manager he had been unfair and grossly aggressive from his very first interaction with us and were just victim blaming and belittling. As we tried to leave the store, a female staff members walks nearby and my father told her he had no idea. She began to almost laugh at us, pointing at a tiny sign hidden in the corner, calling us liars again to which I had to shout three times that my father is dyslexic and cannot read or write, so how would he have been able to understand it? He had to step over the railing to defend himself calmly and explain he was dyslexic, but instead, another female staff member came running over saying ""hey hey!"" as if my dad was doing anything but calmly defending himself. Is this how Aldi treats it's neurodivergent customers? with aggression and contempt for a human mistake made by someone who cannot read or write to know about store policy or generally new laws?Why was my dad apologising at the start, saying he had no idea and would never do it again, not enough? Why, from the get go did the male manager think it was okay to be so aggressive in tone and body language, to call my father sick for being dyslexic and unknowing due to not being able to read or write and treat me, a woman whom he is twice the size of, like a horrible criminal with his bullying and aggressive way of speaking and getting in people's personal space? It was incredibly traumatic and distressing when I have shopped here for two years and never had any issues, have never broken any store rules or policy and have never been anything but abiding. Why would I have never made any mistakes in store yet suddenly witness someone else do it and lie about now knowing store policy or about my father being severely dyslexic?It's all very appalling and has sparked a mental and nervous breakdown.The male manager was twice the size of me or my father and was one of those men with muscles and an ego the size of the statue of liberty. He looked down upon me and my father from the moment the incident happen and called us ""sick"" for ""breaking a law"" we genuinely knew nothing about and was incredibly abusive and aggressive, talking to people in a way no human being should be spoken to. No benefit of the doubt, no understanding - just dismissive, abusive, aggressive, demeaning, belittling, like he was better than us just because a dyslexic man who cannot read or write knew nothing about a store policy or generally new law. I don't think this man would have even spoken to an extreme criminal in the same way he did to both me and my father. Grossly unprofessional, abusive and cruel. Shall never shop there ever again, not that I would be allowed due to something entirely out of my control. Inhumane. Date of experience: May 25, 2024",1

Their complete disregard for customer feedback is appalling, especially given the atrocious behaviour of their staff.On March 29, 2021, at 20:45, I was shopping at the Aldi on Ruscote Avenue, Banbury, and witnessed an absolutely disgraceful incident. A friendly foreign gentleman in front of me was subjected to horrifying treatment by Kath, the customer service assistant at the till.This poor man was struggling a bit, trying to put some items into a bag instead of on the side. Kath's reaction was beyond unacceptable—she started shouting at him, and I mean literally screaming. I was absolutely astounded. I always pack straight into big bags in my trolley, and the mere thought of Kath speaking to me that way made my blood boil. The poor man turned bright red, desperately trying to smile through his embarrassment. He mistakenly entered the wrong PIN in his haste to escape, and as he walked off, Kath screamed at the top of her lungs, ""YOUR CARD HAS DECLINED!""At that point, I felt it was my duty as a human being to intervene. I loudly confronted Kath, telling her she was a rude, horrible woman and how dare she think it was acceptable to humiliate this man. The gentleman, by then completely mortified, rushed out of the store as fast as he could, still trying to smile through his obvious distress.After paying for my shopping, I confronted Kath again, informing her that I would be lodging a formal complaint. Her treatment of the gentleman seemed racially motivated, exploiting the fact that he couldn't defend himself adequately in English. Kath showed a blatant disregard for human decency and basic respect.Upon leaving the store, the gentleman stopped me outside to thank me for my kindness. He revealed that he often shops at this Aldi and is consistently treated poorly by the staff. This is beyond unacceptable.Aldi, you need to retrain your staff immediately. People like Kath should be nowhere near customer-facing roles. If they can't handle basic human interactions with decency, they should be relegated to cleaning toilets or stocking shelves—far away from customers.I will never shop at Aldi again. I'd rather spend my money at a store where the staff know how to treat people with respect and a smile.

I suggested they remove that label as it was confusing and could I replace them with the 28pence beans? He told me they were out of stock but he refused to sell the 4 tins on the checkout at the advertised price or even at a reduction.

He then commented on the strawberries I had purchased in M&S and proceeded to take them out my bag with the pretext of him wanting to see the quality.

So I went back to the store immediately and explained everything to them and they informed me their system were down and they cannot do a reprint. It was really sad as the manager was rude and laughing at me and informed me that the loss of the receipt was my fault and problem . The sheer amount of frustration I felt. When I called the customer service they concluded that nothing could be done. Don’t get me started on the day I lost my money on the same store. I have seen low but Aldi Borehamwood has defined a  new low. I had to pay with my money as I couldn’t provide a receipt.

476,Aldi,Stephen Cooper,GB,"May 12, 2024"," Aldi Glossop ; simply the worstMy review is centred on Aldi Glossop in Derbyshire The manager , Miles, is an exuberant eclectic manager who clearly loves his job , it’s a shame his sub managers and staff don’t share the same qualities.Like so many Trustpilot reviews on Aldi, those reported adverse themes are prevalent in Glossop.Since about March 2024 I gain the impression that Aldi are treating their shoppers as criminals first  and genuine customers well down the list. Having said that there is only one person who has repeatedly requested to see what was in my empty shopping carrier in the trolley,he knows who he is and hopefully feels guilty hiding behind a so- called edict from Head Office. His manner of request was downright abhorrent and lacked any form of narrative other than accusational.I share the view that Aldi stocks a limited amount of stock, food products appear then some weeks later just disappear never to be seen again. I was once told by a representative of a national dairy company that Aldi’s initial negotiating standpoint is always ‘ how much of your product are you going to give us for free’ In addition the quality of fresh produce is appalling; I bought a lettuce well before its best before date, cut into it on my return home and it was brownin large part of the inside. I returned it and it was exchanged  but I was requested to show my receipt, again  a lack of trust and treated like a shoplifter and thus a criminal.Both senior management and other staff are rude. I was  shopping and one assistant came by with a pallet truck with a pallet on it, if I hadn’t have jumped on the pallet my ankles would have been clobbered . Instead of saying sorry he launched into a blistering attack  for me jumping on his pallet. I asked for Miles ( who seemingly) wasn’t there that day, so asked for a manager to which I was told he was the manager; this peaks volumes, if he was a manager he needs to go on an extensive customer training course. This so called manager then went into the warehouse band clearly gave his side of the story to the real duty manager who came and remonstrated with me. He then went to the pallet guy  and I heard laughter and when I passed the manager ( who was applying discount stickers to food) he whistled a childish song. Once again an illustration of abhorrent behaviour.Luckily there is another German supermarket in town  and an alternative Aldi near my daughter’s , so guess where I will be going?  Miles you need to get a grip MATE, I used this term as many of your staff casually use this term obviously not knowing the full meaning of it. I am in my advancing years and thus don’t take too kindly being called MATE by a 20/30s year old, he/ she will never be my MATE.Sadly Miles that’s the end of the road for me at your store, which I suspect has taken a bit of a bashing since the other German supermarket opened in the town  some 2/3 years ago now.  Adios, au revoir Miles, you deserve better than the staff beneath you.Date of experience: May 02, 2024",1

I've put my shopping on the checkout,and waiting my turn. I get to the checkout,and the checkout person asks me what's in a bag that is in the trolley,which has my glasses wallet and phone. She wanted me to show her,I said are you accusing me of stealing. She said no,so I asked why she wanted to look in my bag then? I dumped the trolley with the words that she was accusing me of stealing. I was fuming,the law says you can only search someones bag once they have left the store. I went back to the carpark,realised I'd left the ,£1 in the trolley,and I wanted to speak to the manager. When I got back I told her in no uncertain terms that I don't appreciate being accused of theft. Her answer was they do it to all their customers,I didn't notice this while I was there. So Aldi are calling all their customers thieves,and I believe by doing this they are breaking the law. It's my intention to get further advice from the police,as to whether or not they can do this,without informing the customer prior to entering the shop. If the checkout person had put my purchases through as she should have done,she would have seen me pick up the bag,and get my wallet and glasses out. Both Lidl at Winton,and Aldi at Wallis down are treating their customers as thieves first,and customers last. Yes there is a shoplifting problem at the moment,but again you cannot tackle shoplifters until they have left the store. My advice is give this lot a body swerve until they stop treating their customers like s**t.Date of experience: May 10, 2024",1

I've tried Aldi but I find the choice is very limited and several lines have disappeared, yet when I ask Staff they have no idea why. Prices are increasing by anything from 20p upwards, so I suppose they've done what they set out to do. Open a load of stores, sell things cheap and then, once they have the customer numbers increase prices to get them inline with the other supermarkets. Staff are often seen to be simply stood chatting with friends who are shopping and there is very rarely more than one till open. Not everyone wants to use 'self check-out.' I don't work for Aldi, they don't pay me so why should I check out my own shopping? Why isn't the number of 'self check-outs' reflected in the pricing with prices reducing dur to lower Staff costs?

I happen to like Cheese & Onion crisps just as much as salt & vinegar by the way. Aldi in their infallible wisdom have replaced the previous lovely Sea Salt & Chardonnay Vinegar 6 pack crisps for these, Shopping at Aldi is becoming increasingly frustrating.If they are not changing the packaging on your favourite products then hiding it elsewhere in the store as soon as you like a product they stop stocking it.Oh dear,deary me. What a shame. These crisps are not only a very synthetic tasting version of Mature Cheddar & Red Onion(Yuk!) they are finer cut (ordinary not noticeably “Specially Selected”) as opposed to the previous thicker cut potato crisps. In the 6 pack we purchased most of the crisps were small & the largest fragments resembled corn flakes in size. They taste very much like a cheaper potato & cheaper oil being used too. They are not even on a par with their ordinary cheaper version of Cheese & Onion.The Lidl do a Far superior version of Mature Cheddar & Red Onion in a 6 pack. My advice would be don’t waste your money on these Aldi crisps. They do still sell the larger single bags of the delicious Sea Salt & Chardonnay Vinegar crisps in this range & they haven’t changed the quality or recipe of these-YET.  So if these remain of the same quality thats what I will buy & re bag into smaller bags. By the way pay attention to Aldi’s “Consistently cheaper than other super market prices”. I have made purchases recently that I have subsequently found to be cheaper in Tesco,ASDA etc. Change them back to the previous higher quality Sea Salt & Chardonnay Vinegar 6 packs Please Aldi.Date of experience: May 01, 2024",1

Considering it was raining outside, our typical UK Spring weather, several customers like myself were smiling and affable, the staff were busy stocking shelves but still made time to be attentive to customers, breaking off what they were doing to reach a jar for a diminutive lady, a gentleman asked a member of staff if he would be able to have some help loading a Bank Holiday special Rattan corner unit, flat packed in a rather large box, the member of staff “Yes of course” As ten o’clock approached customers started to load up their goods onto the conveyor belt, a member of staff lit up the light on till 1, a voice trilled “Till No 1 open” and so on until all 5 tills were open and a steady queue of customers at each till waited patiently for 10 o’clock and assistants assembled at all 5 tills for the onslaught.

When we got back to the shop we located him easily and he helped us stack the rest of the set into our car. We are very grateful for his help, we thanked him at the time but we just thought his managers should be made aware of how helpful and friendly he really is (I am sure they know already).

518,Aldi,Helena ,GB,"Apr 27, 2024","Appalling disregard for disabilityAppalling disregard for disability, akin to pure discrimination in Stockport, Offerton Aldi. Used to have pleasant, caring staff. Over the last two months I’ve had to advocate for my partially sighted, mobility impaired elderly father.  Shopping is fine then blatant discrimination at the tills. Shouted at to move when at a green till. Looking at us as though we couldn’t understand them. I’m fine at being assertive and said we wouldn’t move to another till just because the other was free. We’re together, I use a system that works and once safely at a till no way are we reversing (blind and disabled) higher risk of fall. The self checkout member of staff had an argument with me telling me my father was blocking entry to the next till - which was closed!! I told him his behaviour was discriminatory practice and that we weren’t moving! He wasn’t happy. Once at the till the female on the checkout was lovely. My gripe is - zero account of disabilities in a store that will naturally attract many customers because of its good price point. Discriminatory practice - no account of disabilities at the till which is against the law - reasonable adaptations should be made. Ie enabling someone to queue at an open till - lit green when we wheeled our trollies along the till area. Bullying behaviour to try to coerce us to go to a till 2 rows away. As my father enjoys the actual shop there I shall continue to take him. Next time I’ll ensure I have a copy of the legislation to hand to give to the manager for staff training. I’d suggest they get some training from:Stockport council falls assessment team, help the aged and dementia friends so that the intimidatory behaviour ceases forthwith. Interestingly the service in Knutsford Aldi feels very different, the staff don’t try to herd us like sheep and appear more caring to the elderly customers. Date of experience: April 27, 2024",1

Strawberry's several of them had mold on, used to like there chicken bakes but I've now found 2 pieces of bone in them! They also never seem to have alot of products in anymore, since they put all them self checkout tills in they have changed for the worse and hiked up all the prices!

This a branch that we have not visited previously, although we are regular customers of Aldi. At the end we loaded the shopping onto the till. The checkout assistant then said 'lift your bag up', which was placed in my trolley, ready to pack. I lifted it up. She then said 'no all of them'. I then lifted up all my bags. The checkout assistant then said nothing while she started to put the items through the till. Not a thank you for complying with what seemed to be an order nor a greeting. Just silence.  It was clear that we were being accused of having something under our bags, in turn, being accused of being thieves. Once we put out shopping away we were extremely upset and insulted by the way that we were treated, so we asked to speak to the manager. A Deputy Store Manager named Megan came out in an abrupt way. We explained how we had been treated and she stated that the staff member had done nothing wrong. We proceeded to explain that whilst this may be a new rule, there was no signage, no notification of this rule given by the checkout assistant and no communication or word uttered after she told us to pick up our bags. We found Megan to be smirking whilst we were telling her how we felt insulted, and nonchalant about our treatment in store. When I asked to speak to the Store Manager she said whilst smiling again, that she was in charge and that she would be in charge on 21/04 so there was no one else that we could speak to about the matter. It was clear that she did not want this to escalate to the Store Manager, as she did absolutely nothing to alleviate how we felt and actually added to the upset caused. As a Deputy Store Manager, we expected that there would be a level of understanding and empathy for the customer, rather than a rude and careless response stating that there had been nothing wrong with how we were treated.

If the Aldi really has the policy to deal the customers on their physical appearance , race, colour or gender it can be challenged because it is discrimination accusations which is against the UK law.

One of my purchases was a pack of Pork Shoulder Steaks. When I arrived home and was unloading my shopping, I found that the meat had leaked all over my shopping, which meant that the package was damaged. I decided to return only the pork to replace it and not the rest of my soiled shopping to Aldi in Urmston. I spoke with a male store assistant, showed him my receipt, and he promptly remotely asked his store Manager for advice. I was informed that I had to return the meat to the store I purchased it from and they could not help. What kind of customer service is this? How unprofessional.

But then when I showed it to him he said ""No, I need to see inside"". The penny dropped! It can't have been any objective evidence that caused him to think I was thieving because I gave him none. And he didn't ask the same of the person in front of me. So, he must have just thought I looked like a wrong un. Can't help but feel insulted. And as a pensioner with bald head and grey beard, I don't look like the stereotypical shoplifter. Anyway seeing the queue staring at me, I was embarrassed into complying. Now, if Aldi apologise properly for this I might go back. Words mean nothing, but maybe only a punnet of strawberries would do the trick!

However, their soup has now started to have this lining, which is claimed to be 'gender-bending' as it contains Bisphenol A. Also, lots of foods now contain palm oil or palm fat, which tastes yucky and is terrible for South America. Also, lots of products contain artificial sweeteners despite lots of scientific studies proving they are bad for health. The middle aisles seem packed with plastic junk...all gender-bending rubbish.

568,Aldi,Emma Wakefield,GB,"Updated Apr 7, 2024","Confrontational managerThis review isn’t a reflection of all staff, as I’m a regular at my Aldi, and tend to have good experiences.  However last night, I honestly had the worst experience.  I was trying to buy an air freshener, but there was only one left that wasn’t in a sealed case, but it didn’t appear to be the fragrance on the tag. I tried to open a new box to check, but as I picked up the box, the space was narrow so it fell back into the metal bin. It was late at night so it was quite quiet. The manager then stormed over and said she had to come over and said she had come over because of “bashing” and questioned why I didn’t just take the one in the open box.  I apologised and explained the box slipped from my fingers; and asked if it was the fragrance on the tag, as it didn’t say it, and I just wanted to compare it with another bottle in case I’d picked up the wrong one. She then pushed in front of me and finished opening the box, saying that “it obviously will be that” to which my friend said it was quite rude and uncalled for (which it was). She then said “if you don’t like the product get out of my store”, then kept following and taunting us to the point where we just left, and I bought the product.After all this it turned out to be the wrong fragrance, but I don’t want to go back because I’m embarrassed with the whole situation. It was mortifying! Never experienced this before. In absolute shock! The security guard didn’t even intervene which shows we weren’t being confrontational, yet she kept following us and continuing arguing because my friend had the confidence to confront her rude attitude.Thank you to the other member of staff who helped after. Although it turned out it wasn’t the right product, they spoke with me and believed it was the same fragrance because of the similar pictures on the packaging. They dealt with this great, and were understanding, after likely hearing the commotion.Date of experience: April 05, 2024",1
569,Aldi,D. J. T. Reilly,GB,"Apr 6, 2024","Cheap Goods Alongside Cheap Interchange of SpeechI sourced most of the goods I needed to buy from the shelves in an Aldi supermarket – Aldi, 1-4 London Rd, Brighton and Hove, Brighton BN1 4JA  – on the evening of 5th April, 2024. That is all except a bottle of liquor which was kept with others in a locked cooler. To buy certain types of alcohol in this Aldi outlet you have to ask a member of staff to get it for you. Only staff members can access the locked cooler and when they retrieve the liquor they’ll take it to you, verify you’re old enough to buy it and scan it through the payment system. It seems Aldi had a problem with the more expensive bottles of alcohol being shoplifted in this supermarket.I took the goods I collected myself from the shelves and scanned them at one of the self-service check-outs. When I had all my items scanned for payment, I looked over towards a staff member who was on duty in the self-service area: I wanted to get his attention so as to request him to get me a bottle of liquor from the locked cooler.I noticed from about 4-metres away that he had seen me indicating that I needed assistance. I assumed he would approach me to see what I wanted, but he didn’t. Instead, he actually barked at me from halfway across the self-checkout area, I paraphrase: “What do you want”. I was a bit stunned at this response and momentarily lost for words.I also felt a little uneasy about having to practically shout a response to him. So, I made a move towards him so I might tell him in a civil manner what I wanted. Though, I didn’t want leave the self-checkout because the purchases I had just scanned were sitting in the collection bay.But this Aldi employee wasn’t going to waste any time with him and I moving closer together to have our verbal interaction at room volume decibels. I had just moved my right foot a few inches in his direction when he again, with a slightly loudly voice than the first time, barked: “WHAT DO YOU WANT”.I then just stared at him momentarily and realised that I most likely wasn’t dealing with a person who was designed by a creator with civil social discourse in mind.  I eventually managed to inform him of what I wanted, and upon my getting through to him he sharply turned to a colleague and curtly ordered him to go and get the bottle of liquor I’d asked for.As he then walked away towards the other end of the area we were in, I half expected him to start goose-stepping.

They pile it high and sell it cheap, great for those of us who have to adhere to a strict budget. I reckon it makes sense to save where you can.  Not all the products are great but to be fair there are many products that are really good value.However, on my latest visit to Aldi, I sadly noticed a sinister increase in the facial recognition tils that relieve staff of their jobs.  There was a lot of frustrated customers struggling with them as they waited for problems to be resolved.  I headed for the ordinary tills as I don't give my permission to be filmed whilst I am tapping in my PIN number.  Unfortunately, the manned tils at Aldi are also bringing in unwanted changes that customers didn't ask for.  After the assistant rapidly scanned my groceries ( a bit too fast!) I was unable to proceed with my card payment unless I answered a question on the card reader about my shopping experience...it simply wouldn't allow me to skip the question. Seems harmless you might say, but where will it all end up? We seem to be at a critical time in the AI intrusion on our lives.

(good customer service)As the staff point blank refused to let me pay at the self-serve even though I offered to provide evidence with my blue badge that I was disabled they said no. so I said I would have to leave the shopping as I went to leave I realised she had taken my trolley so not only didn’t I have it to lean on to go back to my car but I also had the pound coin in it. When I questioned the checkout support staff about this, I was told I would have to stand there and wait for her to empty the trolley and put the shopping back.So, I have wasted an one and half hours of my day to go home in agony with no shopping I now have to pay someone to go back and shop for me. All of this could have been avoided.Where are your disability support policies? Where is your customer service? I will not shop in your store ever again and I will make it know that your check out rules change from week to wee with no warning. There was no queue what was the problem?I will like a response explaining why disabled customers are lower class in your stores.Date of experience: March 24, 2024",1

I took a large trolley, got my 'bits and pieces' and went to the self-serve to pay. I was told by a staff member there, I could not use the self-serve as I had a large trolley. I told her the only reason I had a large trolley was because there were no small ones.She sent me to the only till open. They sent me to Till 1 which was unmanned. I had to wait for nearly 10 mins for a member of staff. I told her what had happened. There was no signage at the self-serve to tell you you could not use it if you had a large trolley, and if there were no small trolleys available, what was I to do?When an employee came to Till 1, I told her what had happened, and said I felt that the employee had earned 'a Jobs worth award!' I used to work for the Disability Rights Commission as an Advisor on the Disability Discrimination Act ( Now the Equality Act), and adjustments expectations of the Act are reasonable. i.e I have a disability which affects my mobility, there were no small trolleys available which I always use.Aldi, do not expect your staff to enforce your rules, put a sign up at the very least, so people are given the information.Also, I think you need to consider staff training with regards to people with disabilities.I have used the store at Studley regularly and the staff are helpful, friendly and efficient.

However unless you spot the issue there and then, you've no chance of getting your money back. Likewise if you buy something and it's off before the best before date.

This unwarranted intrusion into my privacy made me feel like a criminal, and the lack of consistency in applying this policy among staff members only added to my frustration.Upon reaching out to Aldi Customer Services to express my concerns, I received a dismissive and generic response that failed to address the distress caused by the incident. It seemed as though they were more interested in deflecting blame than acknowledging their mistake and rectifying the situation.Despite my attempts to clarify the circumstances of the incident, Aldi's customer service team persisted in offering vague explanations and insincere apologies. It is clear that they prioritize corporate protocol over genuine customer care, as evidenced by their attempts to downplay the severity of the issue and shift responsibility onto the customer.Overall, this experience has tarnished my perception of Aldi as a reputable and customer-focused retailer. I expected better from a company of their stature, but their handling of this matter has only served to highlight their lack of accountability and empathy towards their customers.I urge fellow shoppers to think twice before patronising Aldi, as their disregard for customer satisfaction and privacy rights is unacceptable.

Been to my Merthyr store this morning and had a very unpleasent experience with yet another self-service console. With not ONE of the manned tills open, the staff member manning the self-service area beckoned me over - which I did...very reluctantly. During the next 15 minute ordeal, he had to come to me no fewer than 5 times to use his fob to reset the console, had to empty the item deck because it wouldnt take the items I had bought and whilst emptying the deck, the console timed-out yet again. In the end, he gave in and called a colleague over to open a till  -which should have been open when the doors opened and customers came in, so that my excess items could be scanned. The transaction took the best part of 15mins whilst customers queued up behind me - a process that usually takes me 5mins taking 3 times longer. I was barely holding my patience, HE was trying to keep his cool with it all - all to save a couple of quid. I could have left the trolley there and walked out. The most infuriating thing was that, upon showing my frustration at the general status of the tills he replied "" I know. Its Aldi policy. They want to FORCE people away from the manned tills onto these self-scans"". Its above his pay-grade, I appreciate that but someone is getting paid a lot of money to push this way of servicing us and the more we just accept it, the more we will be taken for granted. Its made my mind up; I will now flatly refuse to use those things  and will stand at a till and wait patiently until one opens for me. Aldi; mud sticks, and if enough of it sticks, it dont wash off.

Fair enough....but,having just removed the 2 flattened bags from within the trolley and shaken them into a full bag shape - right in front of the operative - then,in this instance,the actions can only be described as discriminatory,as anyone with physically restricted movement (or....for that matter....anyone who is left handed,as the 'desired' trolley position would mean that anyone who is left handed would have to curl around the card machine and protective screen,in order to load their shopping) is expected to endure unneccesary discomfort to comply with Aldi's 'company policy'......Totally unacceptable....I should mention that the store was very well stocked,and the staff are always polite and helpful,and I understand that the operative in question had been borrowed from the Colne store.If I may offer a suggestion to the Aldi suggestion box....why not ask customers to place their bags on the conveyor immediately in front of the shopping,in order that there is no chance of concealing any items,and also allowing sight of an empty trolley as it passes by the till area..?? Not rocket science,but you may just stop alienating all the faithful customers who have supported you over the years.Even Dynamo and David Copperfield would struggle to conceal anything in a completely empty trolley....Footnote: It is the customers with Claude Jeremiah Greengrass poaching coats that you should watch out for.....Date of experience: March 06, 2024",1

My experience of shopping with them - and I have been doing so for many many years now - has always been positive, with the staff very helpful and polite, prices being of excellent value, and the items they sell of good quality. Their malty bloomers are unsurpassed.  Sometimes they don't have the same thing twice but that's Aldi - that's how they keep the prices down. They even have customer toilets in most venues now. My only gripe - and this is across the board at all places that sell groceries - is the use of palm oil in so many things. It's disgusting stuff and very unhealthy.  I only shop elsewhere when Aldi is shut - or if I need Felix cat food.  And if they start selling that I'll probably move in!Date of experience: March 01, 2024",5

But now they are banning trolleys from using them even though they went to the trouble of fitting some of them with space for trolleys. So today I had to queue with everyone else at one of the only 2 very busy tills open while practically nobody used the self-service. It was never a problem using a trolley. Shoppers used to flow through with no problem. Sainsburys and Tesco in Truro both allow trolleys and have never had a problem. Lidl in Truro sadly have not woken up to the fact that we need self-service. Being disabled I have to use a trolley even for 2 items as a walking stick and holding a basket at the same time is impossible.

Staff have instructions to place trays 3 or 4 high with always the Brown bread at the front making the White bread impossible to see and very difficult to reach. Staff and manager extremely rude and arrogant when asked if they could display some of each where it can be easily picked up.  Manager claims it's ""all the same"".

663,Aldi,Trusty,GB,"Mar 1, 2024","ALDI has total disdain for it's customersALDI has total disdain for it's customersIt saddens me to have to leave a bad review, although I would leave ZERO stars if possible.  Equally sad is how ALDI just ignores Trustpilot reviews.What FORCED me to leave this review was calling ALDI UK customer services line only to get cut off, no message, no nothing.  I have been trying for a week now.Today I discovered that they will not accept calls if your number is withheld, they collect our numbers which is deemed by the ICO as personal data and we have a right to withhold our number under GDPR.  This was the straw that broke the camel's back, I have shopped at ALDI since they opened in the UK, I previously recommended them to family, friends and online.  Now I will have to vote with my feet and blacklist them.ALDI was supposed to offer Quality and Value, my call was going to be about the quality drop in a product, they have changed supplier but retain their ""fake brand"", no ""New recipe"" or similar, so consumer has no idea and money wasted.   Particularly annoying if you stocked up on the product.To be honest the Customer Services dropped massively when they moved it out of the UK to South Africa.  I do not blame the staff in SA  because in my experience they are very pleasant and efficient BUT only when given the same tools as the UK staff had.  So previously the UK staff member could tell you if the supplier had changed and they would even know who the supplier was or if there were two.The South African staff on the ALDI call centre told me that they have to search the ALDI website to find a product customers complain about.  The issue with this is they can't find the products, not by description or bar code. What makes it worse is that you no longer can receive an email response from ALDI as you used to get.  Now all you can do is complain and that is it, no feedback, no apology nothing.  Compare that to LIDL who have UK staff, send emails and even include a £5 gift voucher(I was so happy with LIDL's response that I did not even spend the voucher).  This is so different from ALDI who seem to have complete and utter contempt for their customers.This is on top of the recent introduction of the ALDI serve yourself and be closely filmed on video right in your face, because they assume you are a THIEF not a customer.  I can't use those self-service tills anyway, but they found another way to show me their contempt.ALDI recently introduced a second ""assume all customers are thieves"" policy; I had unpacked my items and was approach by a very aggressive member of staff.  This person SHOUTED at me ""PUT YOUR BAGS ON THE BELT"", I said ""I beg your pardon"" and he grabbed my empty shopping bags from my trolley, and threw them onto the conveyor belt.  I took offence at this unruly behaviour and put them back in my trolley, they were obviously empty but this ""little hitler"" got right in my face, within an inch, so close that I could smell his putrid halitosis breath.  Honestly it was like being cattle prodded and being demanded to show my papers in Sieg Heil style.  The cashier was in shock as this ALDI staff member behaviour, since that time I stopped bringing my own bags to ALDI and packed in my car, this has led to me getting wet and dropping things as it was far easier to pack in the ALDI shop, but after that traumatic experience I was not going to allow them to abuse me again.I have noticed that since then there is confrontation between staff and customers over this issue every time I visit ALDI and the Trustpilot reviews I have just seen seem to confirm this.Instead of recommending ALDI my communications to friends and family will be about how awful ALDI are.  People are already posting videos on YouTube about how they have been treated, vloggers now regularly feature stories in the press about negative experiences at ALDI.  One had over 2300 comments from viewers.I used to think these events were one offs but now I have experienced it myself, so sorry ALDI we are DONE.  According to Harvard Business Review it is 22x harder to win back a customer you lost than to win a new customer, think long and hard on that, if I was an investor and had the choice of Hold, Buy or Sell it would be SELL SELL SELL.  The only way back is a very public apology, a revision of the disdain to customers and a massive drop in prices, people like me will no longer shopping there so they will need to communicate widely.Also consider that blocking caller ID withheld numbers means you would have had this feedback privately not shared on Trustpilot.Date of experience: March 01, 2024",1

This is rubbish as I know two store managers and they have no control over what stock comes in. Aldi needs to get their customer service on track who sound like bored angry housewives who are annoyed that they must answer the phone and to switch on a computer would just be far too much.Date of experience: February 20, 2024",1

I always find the checkout staff very helpful and friendly.On the last 2 occasions the cashiers have demanded to search my shopping bags which I always leave open for speedy packing in my trolleyAs a retired Policeman I am not a thief, nor do I want nor need to steal your stock. This behaviour is very insulting and dangerous to your staff as not everybody is as amiable as myself. This method of committing the crime is not the Modus Operandi of most shoplifters, so doing this is antagonising customers, putting your staff in danger and doing little to deal with shopliftingNone of the other supermarkets treat their customers with such derision and if this happens again it will be my last trip to Aldi.

An item had been clearly priced which was queried at the tills. I was informed by Jan that the product was correctly placed and that the price was different to that advertised. I informed Jan that I believed it’s misleading and he said “no it’s not misleading” and continued to advise it’s not misleading, eventually throwing his arms in the air and sarcastically saying “yes of course it’s misleading” and stormed off. If the advertised product is different to the advertised price then an apology and rectifying the misplaced item was all that was required. I appreciate Aldi is what it is and customer service is not a priority, but to be treated with utter contempt by an ignorant member of staff is not acceptable.

I put a few extra items in as I went around the store. When I got to the self service tills I noticed quite a few were closed. I waited until a till became free and then went to use one. The member of staff said ‘you’ve got a trolley you’ll have to wait for the bigger till’. I pointed out that I only had a few items and the person using the one large checkout that was open had a full trolley. There were two smaller checkouts free and my items would fit in one bag. She said ‘there’s a sign’ and pointed to a small sign. I said it says up to 20 items I have less than that. If she’d offered a basket I could have put the items in a basket. She then told me to go to a staffed checkout, which I declined. I would not have gone into Aldi in the first place if they didn’t have self checkouts, queues are always too big at the staffed checkouts. So petty and totally lacking in common sense. I asked her to call the manager. I thought he might have some common sense. Unfortunately not and he was very arrogant too. The same person told another customer to pay for their bag. They said they had brought it with them.

Although they have been the go to supermarket, thankfully the larger supermarkets are now changing their ways to match Aldi, especially when they haven’t put 5p on items but 25p which is a disgrace. The GREED is now setting for Aldi, they need to be very very careful.Date of experience: January 31, 2024",1

Self-service tills are all the staff are interested in directing you to; only 1 member of staff on the normal tills with about 10 customers queuing for it (including me).Forcing people to queue for a long time is being done on purpose to try and get their money's worth out of the self-service tills by hoping boredom will prompt customers to use them.Anyway, the chinese-asian member of staff on the till blanked all those she served (including me). Failed to make eye contact, say “hello” or nod . . . . . or anything to acknowledge people - thoroughly obnoxious. Following payment I start to leave having said “Bye” she holds her hand out with the reciept whilst looking at the conveyor belt expecting me to take it. I did take it and said “Thanks, bye” - met with silence/ignorance, once again.Aldi Ramsbottom are polar opposite - very friendly and they actually talk to you.Today's experience is why I've 85% returned to Tescos. Staff are friendly, tills are open with happy customers who aren't forced to wait for ages. And those working the tills don't throw all your shopping at you like there's some sort of emergency. Additionally, Tescos prices are the same as Aldi (cheaper in quite a few cases) for commonly bought items (milk, bread, eggs, fruit, cereal etc.) and they have far more choice.Date of experience: January 31, 2024",1

The operator closed the till with only two customers in the queue (who had both already put their groceries on the conveyor belt) saying there would be a change over of staff.  He then left the customers waiting to be served. After a few minutes the store manager finally arrived to take over - there was no apology for keeping the customers waiting, he just said ‘y’all right?’. The male customer was understandably not at all happy at being kept waiting and refused to have his shopping bag searched. The female customer was equally annoyed, and said so, but the manager was unnecessarily rude and argued with her, his whole attitude was both sarcastic and unpleasant.  He eventually apologized for the wait when the customer complained again but he continued to argue and be sarcastic to her.  Absolutely APPALLING customer service!! My husband and I were really shocked by what we saw and heard.  No wonder some of the other staff are impolite too, if this is the example set by the manager. To be fair, there are staff who are polite, friendly and helpful, it’s not all bad. But the manager clearly needs a LOT more training, his attitude really does let the store down and reflects very badly on the company. What a shame.Date of experience: January 29, 2024",1

Yet today I have never been treated so badly and yes I paid you to do it to me by shopping in your store  and putting profits in your till which I have done for years as a loyal customer . Aldi repays all shoppers by demanding and it was a demand to see in my shopping bags . Making me feel like a criminal, degrading this was absolutely humiliating no one in front of me or after me was asked to do it . When I complained I was informed all stores are going to be doing  it if not doing so already . Then I said well ask everyone in the store then  . Answer they are supposed to do so - so you are all in for the experience I have gone through if you shop in Aldi.  Whatever happen to innocent until proven guilty??? Do they not realise how they are making people feel , that said yes it’s their right to do this after all it’s their shop, their rules if you shop in there. I had not heard anything about what they were doing until it happened to me. But maybe as people decide to shop in supermarkets that treat you like the decent people majority of people are and it hits their profits - well then they may realise just how much people do not like what they are doing.

What are you talking about?I didn't have any other bags and the rucksack is tiny and was obviously empty. She said that shopping and looked down at the floor.

Twice in one week same lady! They do this action seemingly routinely now to check for anyone stealing items. However, once they've searched my bags into double figure number of times in past months, I do feel they should by now have realised I'm not in there stealing any of their blasted stock. In my regular visits in to purchase items throughout every week. I've heard you're not permitted to refuse your bags inspected since one can then be banned from one's store for not complying. When one has done no wrong. (Some of us do not have personal vehicles. We travel by bus or foot only. So yes, we will have other bags of shopping from other stores with us.)

That despite all trying has not healed properly back to how it was before I injured it instore on one of your store metal racking fittings. It has left me with a finger feeling still slightly numbed, and that seems like it will take many more weeks to heal back to normal. After hurting it there, then the injury at my fingernail getting infected. And I fought that for weeks. I'm still left now long weeks after the injury instore with a loose fingernail with a discoloured nail top. And that with a sort of a dead area underneath it, where the infection was. This injured finger now has a nail that's worryingly no longer fixed to the skin below like it should do, and did do prior to the accident. The front of nail now slightly lifts up and you can see in under the nail! The injury was advised to Aldi at time I did it. Caused by no fault of my own due to a hidden metal fitting that painfully nearly then tore off my finger nail completely. Leaving me in pain and discomfort, and bleeding,  while trying to get first aid assistance from a trained first aider staff member then. Only to find there wasn't one!

It used to have only berries, now it's filled with grapes which are of course a lot cheaper. Stop doing it. If I wanted to buy grapes, I would do it. I feel cheated. Is it a sign of tough times?

785,Aldi,Ellie Rafferty Gray,GB,"Jan 14, 2024","Treated like a criminalI usually use Aldi every week for my main shop and spend between £80 to £100 pounds each visit.Yesterday I visited my usual store at Westcroft Milton Keynes.At the checkout the cashier said 'put your shopping bags on top of your shopping'.When I asked why he replied that it was company policy.He then proceeded to search every single bag.No other checkout was doing this and the people before and behind me sailed through checkout without having their bags searched.I felt really embarrassed and anxious and actually felt like leaving all of the shopping as other shoppers were looking at me like I was a thief.If this is indeed company policy then maybe you should have signage to alert customers they may have to do this so they don't feel discrimated against.Also you should train your staff as to how to request this politely and with respect to the customer.The cashier was rude and arrogant. He couldn't even hand us the receipt once the transaction had been completed. We had to take it from the machine ourselves.I will never be shopping in this store again.

Trolleys are quite difficult to manoeuvre, as one of the wheels has some kind of block. Place was very untidy, Quite a few of the chillers' doors were missing. Everything wrapped in plastic, the quality of their fruit and vegetables appalling. Many vegetables kept in chillers unnecessarily. As I was returning the trolley on my way out, a violent fight broke out between a shoplifter and other men, one of them being the cashier that has just served us. Apparently this is a common occurrence. We  left as soon as we were able, as there were cars blocking every part of the car park, vowing never to return.

I have even noticed that a door has been missing from one of the vegetable units for at least two weeks.

I suffer server mental health and panic attacks. Their behaviour actually left me in a self harming state up my arms. Its discrimination to use someone's illness  against them and i have got the police involved and contacted a legal team.

Maybe the staff get a bonus for writing positive reviews for their company. They sold Kellogs corn flakes for years, then all of a sudden, they no longer sold them for years and now there back on the selves,in small kg boxes. There's many items that Aldi sell or used to sell that all of a sudden are no longer available. So it seems to me that possibly Aldi logistics are abysmal. Or they care more about arguing with their suppliers, than they do about customers being able to buy some basic things. The latest to disappear from shelves for days, if not weeks are DIPLOMAT Decaf teabags. Half the week you cannot get 2 litre semi skimmed milk, but always 4 litre and 1 litre available.

I moved from my regular stores as a large new Aldi opened in Staines in November.  Some of the staff members moved so I decided to go to the new store.My husband and I arrived in the morning.  The car park was close to empty.  On arrival I realized I did not have my small coin wallet with me so popped inside to ask a member of staff to release a large trolly so that I could do my first big Christmas shop.  I saw a young woman adjusting a display and explained my predicament.  She boldly stated ""we don't do that!"".  I was shocked but then saw one of the staff members that I knew and told her I was shocked that no-one (in a near empty store) would release a trolly so that we could shop.  She was lovely (as usual) and said that she would do it, then ""Miss Bulshy"" came up and said ""dont do that, I've already told them NO"".  Both Alison and I were stunned.  I was not aware until Alison told me that ""Miss Bulshy"" was her manager.  I told her not to worry as we would go and shop elsewhere and told Alison not to get in trouble.Absolutely disgraceful behavior's by the manager.

823,Aldi,Mr Arthur Allen,GB,"Dec 22, 2023","Auto XS windscreen cover with magnets and door mirror covers - Useless.There was a time when I trusted Aldi products and their ""special buys"" which used to be good value for money are not so ""special"" anymore.  That said, I was tempted by the recent in-store offer of the Auto XS Windscreen Cover with magnets along the bottom edge and door mirror covers on elasticated straps.  The concept of the windscreen cover looked good as it meant that not only would I have a clear windscreen after a frosty night, but I wouldn't be scraping door mirrors clear either.  Plus, the reason why this product really appealed to me was that it has the width to fully cover the windscreen and about 75mm of the back edge of the bonnet which means that the wipers are covered as well and the loads of leaves we get round our way would not be filling the void behind the bonnet, getting into the engine bay and blocking up the drainage holes where the wipers are mounted.  The cover appeared to work well the first time that it was used and did all that I required of it, but it must be said that it was a rather still night with little wind. During the second night of use there was some wind with gusting.  I was stunned the next morning to see that the cover was not even still on the car and it was nowhere to be seen.  Despite the magnets and the door mirror covers and the wings being firmly trapped between the windscreen pillars and the doors the cover had somehow been pulled free and had blown down my driveway.  I did find it and discovered that one of the only two magnets had somehow come out of the too delicate material from which the cover is made during its wind blown adventure.  A second cover I had bought at the same time was still in place on another vehicle but it was evident from observation what had happened to the other one.  The two magnets intended to secure the bottom edge to the metal of the bonnet are simply not strong enough to hold it there and the cover was repeatedly lifting in the wind, uncovering half of the windscreen and then, as the wind eased a bit, flopping back down onto the bonnet and you could hear the magnets striking the bonnet as the cover dropped.  This was particularly disconcerting as in the user instructions the user is warned to take care when fitting and removing the cover to avoid clanking the magnets against the bodywork and causing possible damage.  Apparently Aldi/Auto XS didn't test it thoroughly enough to determine if the same thing could happen on a windy day or night when a wind could spring up and you would know nothing about it until you found your cover dislodged and magnets banging against your paintwork.  The cover which became completely dislodged from one of our vehicles had also lost one of its magnets making the cover as good as useless even though it was pretty useless to start with.1) The wings do not provide sufficient surface area to effectively secure the cover to the vehicle.2) The magnets are ineffective in holding the cover onto the back edge metalwork of the bonnet.3) Once the bottom edge is lifted the wind gets fully underneath the cover and it can be fully blown from the vehicle.4) The magnets are not securely held inside the covers.  One of mine was readily lost.  They will not work anyway (as you would expect) on a non steel vehicle which is obviously non-magnetic.5) Once the bottom half of the cover has been wind lifted there is the possibility that it will stay lifted and half of your windscreen will no longer be protected from frost and in my case the ingress of leaves will still occur.These Auto XS windscreen covers are a good idea gone badly wrong.  Do not waste your money.  They are not worth the hassle.  I only wanted to stop the ingress of falling leaves and the nuisance they cause to me.  The width of the covers was excellent for this purpose and I have modified the covers bought by setting eyelets into the bottom corners and used bungee straps to secure each corner to the front wheel arches.  The covers now no longer lift in a wind and the wind-blown leaves are no longer a problem.I have made them work for me, others might not be able to do the same so save yourself the trouble and don't buy them.Date of experience: December 18, 2023",1

However, this time, I received some very poor customer service. I went to get 4 pints of milk from the shelf. As I placed it in my trolley, a young female employee asked me if she could get in front of me to push a fully loaded trolley of milk in place. She was in a hurry and couldn't wait for me to finish. But I politely moved out of her way. After she pushed all the milk in place, she walked away as a 4 pint bottle fell down onto the floor and covered my trousers and suede boots in milk. I was soaked. I called after her to show her what had happened after her impatient actions. She shouted back at me and said that she hadn't done that and tried to blame me even when I had already moved out of her way and already had my milk in the trolley. She didn't come back to even ask me if I was ok or offer to help. I asked her if she was going to help clean the mess up, and she said with attitude, that's what she was going to do. She even looked amused at how I looked in the mess. To make matters worse, I was so upset and asked another female employee to find the manager for me. As I was explaining the situation to her, a co-worker (who wasn't even at the scene) began to back up the employee in a raised voice. I felt they were teaming up against me before I spoke to the manager, all in front of the other customers. I felt humiliated. The female manager eventually came out to see me. She was actually understanding and apologetic, and said the other employees should not have got involved. She said I could use the toilet to dry myself off. I told her that I was just too upset to come back to the store again that I have shopped at for years. I left my trolley of shopping in the store and left, I didn't even retrieve the £1 coin. I had to wash my trousers on a hot wash and my boots are now ruined even after wiping the suede down, they smell of stale milk and are stained. Eventually, I got through to customer services, and  I suggested to them to watch the CCTV to see exactly what had happened by the milk section. I was offered a voucher to spend in an Aldi store. It didn't exactly cover the cost of the boots, besides the whole experience. I will only shop occasionally in the Knutsford store.

After getting home, when we opened the packs for cooking dinner, we were shocked to see that many potatoes were damaged and had to be binned. I am shocked at I thought Aldi sells quality stuff and these potatoes were not reduced items but sold at usual price. I have the receipt and thought of complaining but ALDI has cleverly inserted a clause that offers a refund or exchange of the spoiled product if you take it to the STORE where one bought it. I live quite far from Feltham and Aldi shop where I bought. There is no phone number to call for refund or complaint on the receipt either.

Bag-check is 'by consent' but if you don't consent they have to call the Manager and an intimidating interview ensues.  Making regular, loyal and honest customers feel like they might be criminals is wrong. In the UK I had though we were 'innocent until proven guilty' but when I politely ask if I am being accused of committing a crime and where is the evidence, I am assured I am not.

Unlike previous occasions the till operative was not distracted by having a chat with who ever was at the other end of a headset. Obviously the discount stickers are not prominent enough for Aldi staff as this has happened to me several times by several operatives. For the shopper to see a % discount is not really enough as the shopper has then to seek out and calculate what the discount is worth in cash terms.

On both occasions it was the same person, I’m sorry I didn’t notice his name badge, my mistake. I made a point of making sure the 30% off stickers were uppermost but he still missed them both. On the first occasion I didn’t notice until I’d got home and I’d checked the receipt. I had to let it go because the saving was only around 50p and it would have costs me more in fuel to go back to the store. Today I checked the receipt whilst in the store at the packing area, but when I turned round there was a queue of five people at the check-out and I wasn’t going to embarrass myself going back to him to complain he’d missed my 18p saving. Instead I paid full price for a near out of date item. This lad is taking peoples money at the check-out and needs to concentrate on what he is there to do instead of laughing and joking with colleagues whilst pushing items through at speed. Looking at the receipt, it doesn’t look like they put the operators name on there, but to try to describe him he was on check-out number 1, and he sounded like he had a midlands accent. I don’t want to get the lad into trouble, I’d just like him to do his job better, just in case I buy another discounted item and get to the check-outs and find there’s only one operating and he’s working on it.One big way of improving is to stop non-essential chatter on the headpieces. Also today whilst picking fruit in a near deserted aisle I could hear an Aldi employee with his head in a fruit & veg cabinet doing what I thought was laughing to himself, on reflection he was probably chatting to a colleague. Finally, I had to take this route because Aldi’s online complaints process is horrendously difficult to navigate.Date of experience: November 23, 2023",1

Everything was okay at best up until I went to pay and leave. I went to the self service till with a basket and paid. I was watched during this but I don't mind this as sometimes we have to do it at the store I work at. Since I was watched while I paid you would think I would then be free to leave. This was not the case as the security asked to check my rucksack. When asked if there was a reason behind this I was told its policy. Policy to check a rucksack with no reason? I would understand if I had not bought anything or if I had even put my shopping in my bag after I paid. However, I was watched while I paid and packed a shopping bag rather than putting it in my rucksack. When questioned about the policy, the guard said that it was a 'managers policy' not aldis. I understand this is a new store and there will be some teething issues but a manager who would put this in place should not have been given that job in the first place. I understand that the pompey centre has a lot of issues with thieves, I have seen it first hand since I work in a store nearby but if I had checked a customers personal belongings without valid reason of suspected theft I would have been dismissed! Being forced to show your personal belongings when no valid reason has been given can be considered harassment, cause distress and embarrassment especially when not even asked discreetly. Joyline Dapadap from customer service online would only try to back the store up and did this by lying about their policy even though this can be accessed online. When caught out on this they changed their answer to it being a 'short-term measure' rather than their original 'national policy'. Clearly there is a lack of training being given to Aldi employees.

When  I returned to the store to get them correctly priced the Aldi employee merely stated that they were subject to in-store re-pricing.

Now I know its getting on to the busy period however, their hand baskets are manky and have been for a while now.  Is there not some kind of rules for every supermarket to give their hand baskets a good clean every once in a while.  Lately when I pop in for a few ods and ends I have to search through the plastic hand baskets situated at the entrance to find the least manky one, bearing in mind I am putting food in them.  Secondly, and I hate to have to say this but Aldi are joining the ranks of Tesco by putting the wrong price label in front of the wrong product. This has been happening for weeks.  Its so frustrating. In Aldi's case they cannot give the excuse that a customer must have put the product back in the wrong place (which is usally the excuse Tesco give) because its whole cartons of product not just the odd item.Date of experience: November 12, 2023",2

This issue raised its head in August and having visited numerous other Aldi shops between this time and today, no other store I attended has ever requested to check my bag or that of any customer that I am aware of. I made the mistake of returning to Uttoxeter today only to be insulted again. I was asked to lift my bag from the trolly, despite it being as flat as a pancake and clearly having nothing in it. When I asked why, the excuse given was there might be something hiding underneath. Clearly this is a new tactic to check bags. I was told a recent theft of £1000 worth of meat has made these checks necessary! Well, all I can say is Aldi need to invest in better security if someone was able to leave with that quantity of meat under a bag in their trolly! Or maybe all staff need to go to spec savers? I told her no other Aldi store checks bags and she said they should be and she will report this to her manager. I cannot find any blanket policy for this behaviour. Previous media reports state this is an individual store policy. I WILL NOT BE SHOPPING AT UTTOXETER AGAIN, which I clearly told the assistant. I tried to complain directly to Aldi but they don't appear to have a complaints policy about store experiences, only products and compliment. I would suggest you improve your in-house security rather than accuse your customers without cause. Or is it an excuse to keep a check on your employees as the checkout assistant made it clear to me that she was being watched to ensure she was checking customer bags? Aldi need to be transparent about what their policy is and advertise this clearly, giving customers the choice of whether they want to shop there before they feel degraded and insulted whilst making their purchases. No other supermarket behaves in this way. If you want to truly reduce crime think about returning to a proper customer service ethos by packing bags for customers instead of throwing their purchases at them and stop all this self service rubbish.Date of experience: November 03, 2023",1

The toy event had started on Thursday so knew the items would sell out fast.  Various sets had been advertised online so was determined to get the ones my twins wanted for Christmas. In tow on walking into the store, I had a bag full of PAID items. The assistant in the store offered me a basket as I had picked up some groceries, unfortunately, the toy items I wanted were not in the store so I paid for the groceries and proceeded to leave the store.  On exiting the same lady asked if I paid for the items I’m my bag!!!! Wow, this was in full view of a very busy store when I had not done a thing wrong. I then proceeded to show her my PAID for items in a bag to which she checked the receipts, her face dropped when she saw I had paid for every single item.  No apology was made and all she said was “I’m just doing my job”!!! Customer services said this approach of asking customers such questions has recently been implemented due to high levels of theft and whilst Darren was somewhat sympathetic as the previous handler Karen did nothing to defuse my frustration he admitted he would not be able to guarantee this won’t happen again however he agreed the approach was not the best from the staff member.I asked where the signs were to confirm these new rules and the manager  could not confirm this As a goodwill, he offered £20 voucher!!Will not be back as still fuming from the situation disgusting and still feel embarrassed and humiliated.Date of experience: October 23, 2023",1

987,Aldi,Jillian Anny,GB,"Oct 20, 2023","The deteriorating customer experience at the Aldi store in Horsted, ChathamI am writing to express my deep disappointment and frustration regarding the shopping experience I have had at the Aldi store located in Horsted, Chatham. Over the past several months, I have noticed an unsettling change in the store's practices, particularly in the way they handle customers' bags at the checkout.It has become a regular occurrence for staff to inspect customers' bags at the tills. This not only makes me feel like a potential thief but also subjects me to a level of embarrassment that is uncalled for during a simple shopping trip. After each visit, I find myself questioning whether I appear ""poor"" or ""unsmart"" based on the staff's actions.I understand that the staff is following company policies, and I do not fault them for carrying out their duties. In an attempt to avoid any embarrassment, I have consistently left my bags open for inspection without waiting for them to request it. However, my recent shopping experience was particularly distressing.On this particular visit, I was shopping with my three young children, whom I had just picked up from school. It was a challenging situation as my kids were understandably tired and restless. When it was my turn at the checkout, the staff's response to my presence was far from the courtesy I expected. I had to wait there for the process changing shifts between the colleague. Instead of offering a simple ""sorry"" or a ""thank you for waiting,"" the staff requested, ""Can you lift up your bags?"" This made me feel even more humiliated as it seemed they suspected I might be hiding items underneath my only two empty shopping bags on the trolley.I managed to remain composed, assuring myself that this was merely a game of ""hide and seek."" After the scanning was completed, I was informed that a product required a code, and I patiently agreed. During this time, I was left waiting while the security guard stood directly in front of me. To my shock, he yelled, ""hey, you, get down from there."" I turned to find that it was my son who had stood up on the packing table, and he was now trying to get down in fear. I promptly held my child back and informed the security guard that he should not address my children with a casual ""hey."" It is important to remember that there are more appropriate words in the English language, especially when addressing children.Subsequently, when the staff member serving me returned with the product code, she inquired about the incident with the security guard. Regrettably, she stated that the guard had not uttered those words, which left me feeling dismissed and unheard. Although the advice she offered regarding my child's safety was appreciated, it was evident that the matter had evolved beyond safety concerns. At this point, it had become a matter of basic courtesy and my pride as a customer.Following the incident, I completed my payment and left the store. There was no acknowledgment, appreciation, or thanks offered by the staff. I was left pondering why I chose to pay for my essentials amidst an environment that subjected me to unwarranted judgmental behavior.Date of experience: October 19, 2023",1

27,Asda,naiomi tamakloe,GB,2 days ago,"Not so disabled friendly My mother visited Asda Clapham Junction with my brother today, she is disabled and opted to use one of the mobility scooters avaliable. However the scooter ran out of power quite quickly after just 5 minutes or so and my brother had to leave my mum in the aisle while he ran to get another. She has anxiety and was petrified but there was no member of stagg around willing to help. He returned quickly with a second scooter and helped her into it but after another 10 minutes the same thing happened again. He ended up having to drag it to the door with my mother in it. My 70 year old mother was both shaken and embarrassed. Trying to get her to come out is difficult and after today it will be even harder to get her to commit to a shopping trip. What makes it worse is thaty brother said that the staff were so apathetic and even he said he felt really stressed by the whole thing. They spent over £120 and would have spent a lot more if they didn't have to cut the trip short. I must caveat this by saying that I personally have met a number of excellent staff at this store but its just a shame my mum had such a bad experience today. Date of experience: November 17, 2024",1

Then, after providing everything requested, ASDA responded three days later (long wait again....) with instructions to return the product with packaging to the store! (DID THEY READ MY EMAIL?

I’ve encountered ongoing issues with either the staff or the products, and my experiences have consistently been frustrating.The staff, from the manager to the cashiers, have often been rude and unhelpful. When I ask for help finding a product, they often act as if they’re doing me a huge favor by answering my questions.On one occasion, I was looking for trousers for my daughter and had trouble finding the correct size. Instead of offering assistance, a staff member yelled at me for supposedly “messing up” the order of the sizes. That interaction was enough to make me put the trousers back and leave the store.During my last visit, I needed light bulbs. Since the packaging was closed, I couldn’t check the contents inside. When I got home, I discovered that the pack only had one bulb instead of the full set. This wasn’t the first time I’ve had issues with products here, and it just added to my frustration.In the end, I’ve decided that I won’t be shopping at Asda anymore. After multiple unpleasant experiences, I’ve lost confidence in their service and product quality. Shopping here has become more of a hassle than it’s worth.Date of experience: November 13, 2024",1

Because of this I couldn't request refunds or access my (so called) Rewards. As suggested I 'tried again later' several times, up until 11.30pm. Still nothing. The chat bot is very annoying as there is nowhere where you can lodge a complaint - it just takes you round and round the same loop on the website/app. Today it initially said I have no further orders placed, despite two already having been accepted. I won't be using them for the majority of my shopping in future.

This is the second time my order has not arrived, and the lack of communication is unacceptable.We placed an order for essentials, expecting it to arrive on the agreed delivery day. However, the order never came. I understand that delays can happen, but the real issue here is the complete lack of communication. I made four phone calls to customer service, and each time I was lied to. I was told the order would be with us in 30 minutes, but it never arrived. On the first call, I was told I would receive a callback within 5-10 minutes—which never happened.To make matters worse, this happened on a Sunday night, and we were left without essentials. Our young children couldn’t even have breakfast the next morning, which, as any parent knows, is a stressful situation.Despite the repeated false promises, I still have not been informed why my order was cancelled, and my payment is still pending. There has been no explanation or resolution, and the customer service experience was nothing short of shocking.I would have been willing to overlook the random substitutes, missed delivery slots, and delays, but the lack of communication and transparency is a dealbreaker.

Asda have email addresses & tel. Nos..why not ring to advise of the situation! Why get customers to choose & pay for delivery/ collection slots when the goods just don't turn up! I've waited over an hour extra before & even had an order simply not appear. Several times with home delivery it does not turn up. ASDA ASDA ASDA - You were phenomenal during the pandemic,you can't even notify customers who's money you've had for days in some cases, that the order slot is not available!

175,Asda,John,US,"Nov 8, 2024","ASDA more honest than competition, but still disappoints at timesWhile ASDA is probably one of the more honest supermarkets in the UK, that doesn't apply to their online grocery shopping. Their George online is also a mess. I've ordered my weekly shop from ASDA, off and on, for a few years now, and again, while they are notably more reliable and honest than Sainsburys online, they still do things that are annoying. Here are some things they do1. Make out that an item is in stock up past 11pm the evening before your groceries are due. Then, at 10am, you get an email saying your order is missing 3 items due to  being out of stock. Really. 2. They dont let you tick the sub button on non food items, which isn't fair. I tried to get toothpaste, and they didnt have the one i wanted, so now i'm left with barely any toothpaste. thanks ASDA. 3. Their pickers often push food on you that is about to expire. I've been given foods that have same day expiry date, or one or two days. Not very good, that. And they dont always give you a refund when you request one. They do refuse sometimes. Especially with baked goods. 4. They can take a while to refund your card, but at least they refund your car, unlike Sainsburys, who refuse to. 5. They are often out of stock of LOTS of items, and that gets very frustrating. 6. A few times, where they have put something on offer, it's not reflected in the final price. Oops, they forgot...7. The quality of their food isn't as good as, say, Sainsburys or Marks and spencers. 8. Prices continue to rise. Date of experience: November 05, 2024",2

179,Asda,Anne ,GB,Updated 3 days ago,"MORE SYSTEMS PROBLEMSSo I have a grocery order booked with Asda, for delivery in December. I have decided that I would like to place another order, for delivery between now and then, but their systems will not permit me to do this and so Asda is losing money, as I will have to go elsewhere for this interim delivery. I am spending a lot of time planning and sourcing food as I have IBD and I do not wish to be hanging out for 2 days or more in A&E stuck to a drip over the Christmas/NY period,  nor at any other time, and that is after waiting for anything up to 2 days in that freezing cold and well infected place with no food/drink, getting more and more sick, to be seen by a doctor at all. And I really don't fancy surgery, especially when there is hardly any medical staff about. Can we all be working together? Your mum/child... may need A&E. Your husband.. may fall off a cliff. I am trying to protect your interests and three or more times over (as usual). And dear Trish, very often these days, no receipt is issued by many a (larger) store. The staff is able to locate your purchase in their systems without it, though having a rough idea of the date and time is tremendously helpful. And dear James, a lot of people still think they would like to be disabled/sick and weak. We all think we know what pain is, for example, but there is always more. I am so sorry for what happened in store, to someone in need of extra and tender, physical care. Each one of these is doing their best and has feelings (too). They are real, human beings and very peaceful and gentle ones, dearly loved by God. When every one is sick, injured and physically weak, priorities will be correct, every one will be thankful and there won't be any more violence/wars. Instruments of Mercy in this world - in service to God and deeply blessed. In fact, the greater the persecution, the more graces. Thank you Lord God.

180,Asda,Consumer,GB,"Nov 5, 2024","Avoid whenever possible, it’s not worth the stress and lack of care! Asda delivery service has become a nightmare. I dread shopping here. (Often it’s the only choice due to slot availability in Tesco or other stores) -unreliable. The store often mess up orders, meaning you don’t get everything you ordered and have to wait till they are able to deliver the rest. Or they mess up so bad that you don’t get the order at all and have to cancel (wait days for refund) then shop again. They will not help to correct their errors. Communicate is appalling. When contacted they don’t respect you. They are rude, pass blame and even hang up. Website and tracking has gone down hill. Delivery updates don’t seem to happen anymore. You have to wait to see if it will show up today or not. Employees are unprofessional and lazy! I have ordered and watched out the window for the delivery. I have watched the driver park up go to the chip shop beside my house and get in the van to leave. When I’ve ran out to ask about the delivery they have admitted they weren’t going to attempt to delivery due to it being late and a large order. The drivers often complain about the pick packers as they are lazy and don’t bother looking for substitutes, which really bothers me as Asda have a substitute policy and are suppose to provide one of possible. They do not try. The food comes squished, leaking and broken often, due to their inability to pack the creates. The lack of care with in this company is disheartening. I have 3 unavailables this week AND 17 substitutes. Most of which are lower quality. I continue to shop with Asda simply because I don’t drive, have young children, a disabled child and can’t always get slots with other stores. Luckily iam mobile and have no health issues.

182,Asda,Andrew Hacker,GB,"Nov 3, 2024","Avoid, Avoid, Avoid!!!I have been shopping with Asda for 15 years and never had any issues until the last two times I’ve ordered a fortnightly food shop via their app. First one, the order was supposed to arrive between 6-7pm. At 10pm it still hadn’t arrived and received a text to say the order had been cancelled with no explanation.Second time, it was supposed to arrive between 6-7pm. When it hadn’t arrived by 7:30 I called them. They advised that they were having some technical issues, but that it would be delivered, and if it wasn’t, the order would be cancelled and my money would be refunded. I gave up and went to bed at 11pm. Checked the app in the morning and it said the order had been delivered when it hadn’t. I called customer service, who processed the refund and advised that it would take 3-5 working days to receive the refund. They also gave me £15 vouchers for the inconvenience, which initially I was happy with.  Still needing food, I placed another order which was identical to the one that never arrived. The delivery slots available for a whopping £9.99, and the vouchers that they had given me didn’t work. This order did actually arrive, but it was a third party who sent texts asking for instructions. I sent instructions, but he didn’t follow them, he just called me and said he was here. When I was putting the order away,  numerous items were damaged and missing. Admittedly, it’s very easy to report things like this via their app, but still. I genuinely don’t know what’s happened to Asda, but the service has rapidly declined. For my next food shop I intend to use Tesco.Date of experience: November 02, 2024",1

It was very busy, possibly because of the fact that we are approaching the Christmas Festivities. I was in the self-service checkout with my trolley. The place was very busy, and there was a problem with the items I was putting on the machine, so I needed to call the shopping assistant for help. It took too long for the person to come, so I told the assistant that they need more workers as I don’t like to wait so long. She told me she can do nothing about it, and she said she needs to tell that to the manager. So I told her to tell the manager that you need more workers. Then I had another issue with another item so I needed to wait again, and the same worker came again, and I told her again that she needs more workers, as I don’t want to wait too long. I was trying to be very friendly with the staff as I could see she was working under pressure but I could see as well there definitely needed to be more staff to help with the customers needs. After that, a manager named Kelly came, she was not very polite, in the way she answered to me, and there was no customer service at all. Then I told her the same thing I told to the shopping assistant, the manager had told me “where do you want me to get the workers from.” I believe this is a very wrong answer and impolite and again missing the point of what customer service should be about. Well I told her that this isn’t my problem, It’s not my business and I’m just a customer here, asking for service. Then the manager (Kelly) had told me that I was being rude to the shopping assistant. I replied to her I have never been rude to anybody, I respect everybody. I cannot believe it because I complained in the right manner and they accused me of being rude.I told the manager to call the shopping assistant to come by and ask her how I had been rude, and she simply refused.It really stressed me out, my wife and children were waiting in the car and she asked me what happened as she noticed I wasn’t right.I believe Asda workers are well-trained to help with any customer situation especially when you’re a manager. She cannot simply approach me with an unfriendly tone and say “where do you want me to get the workers from?” This is simply not right.I feel sorry for the Asda staff members, working under high amounts of pressure, due to the reason Asda can’t afford to put other members of staff on the floor to help and the customers have to pay for it.Date of experience: November 09, 2024",1

But the thing is that instead of these replaced products, they decided to put 2 expired cottage cheese instead of the ordered butter and instead of regular kefir, also expired. It seems that if they had all the expired products that I ordered, they would have brought them to me. This is disrespectful attitude towards customers. We pay money to receive quality service and the product we ordered. Stay away from this shop.Date of experience: October 30, 2024",1

Sell by date 03/11/24. looked for others - all hard and cold (i.e. frozen). Spoke to assistant who says ""they all come in like that"". Asked to speak to a manager (Jo the bakery manager) who told me the same.  I said ""but you are selling them as fresh bread ""- she says ""no it doesn't say fresh"". I said ""it doesn't say pre-frozen either. What if I want to freeze them?"" She said ""that's your choice""  I said but the product is misleading and I wished to complain.She wouldn't take my details. She said ""we are allowed to do this, we have a legal team and its all above board.  Asda has been selling them like this for 5 or 6 years and no-one has become ill as a result."" So half a star for Asda passing of frozen rolls as fresh bread, and half a star to the bakery manager Jo for her handling of my complaint.Date of experience: October 30, 2024",1

Competitive prices used to be a positive, however, Aldi and Lidl are now streets ahead in that category.We’ve used Asda home delivery service for months and it’s gotten progressively worse. Numerous items unavailable each and every time, items as simple as yoghurt or cooked chicken; even more substitutes for items that aren’t even similar; totally unreliable delivery times, and should they not turn up at all it’s a hassle to get a refund.

The delivery charge was £5 and my donation was £1. I took a look at the last order that was delivered, which was on 19/10/2024 and the price of that order was £42.18 However I took a look at my bank statement and I had been charged £48.77 for this order. I contacted Asda Customer Services and told the lady I spoke to about the discrepancies of both orders, and the overpayment of the first order was put back into my bank account. However the payment of £47.33 was showing as pending. This meant that the payment hadn't left my bank account, because it could be fraudulent. I looked yesterday, to see if the overpayment had been put back into my account and it hadn't, although the payment of £47.33 was still showing as pending. I have just looked now and the payment of  £47.33, has now left my bank. It is plainly obvious to me, that Asda had no intention of returning the overpayment to me. Due to the fact that  I had looked at the reviews about Asda on Trustpilot, which were bad, on the day I made my complaints to Asda, I cancelled my debit card from my Asda account, but I was unable to cancel my account. Asda have obviously kept hold of my debit card details, for them to be able to take out the payment of £47.33. I am now going to take this matter further and I would urge anyone who places an online order with Asda, to check their bank accounts, to make sure that Asda do not take out more money than their order states it should be.Date of experience: October 25, 2024",1

So the First Lady came out , I Asked her, her reply was”I’m looking for someone myself love” and walked off 😳, as I stood their checking my ears, another Asda ‘nomad’ walked by me rolling crates, I said “excuse me, you’ve got an offer on 12 cans of Guinness, I was wondering if you could check in the back see if you have any?. Too which she replied….. I’ve been in the back where the Guinness would be, and there’s none their, the only thing in the back is spirits in the spirits section, I said “are you sure, because there’s only enough room in the rack for about 3 cases, she said.”yes, I’m sure I’ve been in and there’s nothing” . So I said ok, but my suspicion of her answering so fast got the better of me, so I went back to click and collect/customer services, and asked again and told the woman what happened, she said “hang on there and I’ll get someone to check, promptly an bloke came and said come and show me what you need and I’ll have a look. I took him to where they’re supposed to be, he got a digital phone like thing out, scanned it and said, “it’s showing we’ve got loads, how many do you want “😳 I only wanted one, off he went and bought it to me. This saved me driving over to Perry Barr or great bridge to look for some, when all the time, they were behind the double doors I was waiting by. The Asian gut went above and beyond, I didn’t get his name, but he was superb and done what he was paid for, the other 2 women had the charm of a boil on yer eyelid, and couldn’t even be bothered to listen never mind help. I weren’t the happiest of people and after I put my shopping in the car I went back in to confront the blonde liar about what she’d said, and told her what happened, to which she said “ooh, I’m sorry about that “ with the sincerity of a snake after eating an egg”. I complained at the time, but didn’t have time to wait around as I was in the afore mentioned rush.

I received no notifications that it wouldn't arrive. The same thing happened two days ago because Asda ""didn't recognise my payment card"", though I only found this out after the order didn't arrive.I called your customer service who spent more time putting me on hold than speaking with me. All he could tell me is the order would probably be cancelled and he might call me back this afternoon with some information if he manages to get hold of the store. he babbled unnecessarily, repeated himself I'm assuming just to waste more time and avoid telling me that ultimately, the call would be useless and get me no closer to getting the order I have tried to make twice. It took two more calls to speak to a very helpful person at the Hamilton store, and to find out the driver apparently tried to deliver at 8:08am. This is not correct. My partner was waiting at the window at this time. In fact, he even saw an ASDA van drive further down the road passed us at roughly this time assuming he was dropping off somewhere nearby first, before coming to us. He did not come here. He did not knock on our door. We were not phoned. I didn't receive an email. My account online did not indicate any issues. Despite the catalogue of errors, ASDA couldn't offer a solution. When asked I was advised, he wasn't due back in the store until 3pm so that was the problem with getting the order to me.I am sick with what could be a  chest infection but could apparently also be COVID and now I have to go to the shop in person to spread my illness on to other customers unfairly and unwisely.

Dear Asda (Plymouth),Before complaining a little homework checking out Asda reviews see Trustpilot complaints at 1-star to be 79% and 5-star at 9%, which means Asda are hardly likely to respond other than an apology as a simple cure to resolving anything in store.Shopping previously always using the hand held check as we shop, on paying yet another product check at 27 items. The assistant was pressured encouraging us to complain as she was understaffed and apologised noting how well individually our bags were packed, which is the whole idea self packing whilst shopping only to be told after asking we had to repack our shopping ourselves, hardly good customer service.Observing how few other customers were using the system talking of the same poor service preferring to use the old system at checkout. At that point we tipped out £250 of shopping recovering our bags and left.I fully understand being quality checked even if it was the whole trolley, but I did not expect to repack it myself. Especially at my age and health repeating what I had just done walking around the shop. The whole idea of shop and go hardly works.Continuing on to Sainsbury’s a few miles away it was interesting discussing our problem with a shopper there who lived within walking distance of Asda preferring to drive to Sainsbury’s having experienced the same poor service at the Plymouth store refusing to shop there.Footfall hardly makes it worth a complaint as customer loyalty hardly exists as so many other stores are similar with poor service. Perhaps you need to look after your staff better, who in turn would look after your customers.

Nothing showed by 12pm so i had to call “customer service” who said go to the shop and get it yourself em no i do home delivery for a reason. I wasn’t offered another delivery slot- i was told my options were to go to the store or cancel. I cancelled my order to then be told I’d have to wait 3-5 working days for a refund. (What if that’s all the  money i had) I’m now left £135 out of pocket and no shopping. I went back online to order between 6pm-7pm. 7.05 no shop delivered.  I was contentious of the time as i was Heading to work for 8pm. Called “customer service” again who said it will be delivered about 7.30. Absolute joke when I’m relying on the shopping for items to cook and then the timings now making me late for work. I’ve used this service for the best part of a year now and can assure I won’t be back using an unreliable service. I was offered £5 for my inconvenience which is an absolute joke. I work in customer service and i tell you had i treated my customers like I’ve been today I’d be out of a job. ** Update no shoppping arrived @7.30 - drives pulled up outside house then drove away after 5 minutes. i then had to call again to be told oh your order wasn’t on the truck.

They were brilliant through Covid and got us through the worst of it but this year they have been utterly useless. The fees for express has gone up, yet the order system is not fit for purpose and doesn’t give you up dates, late deliveries, rude drivers, whole sections/aisles missing from orders so it looks like they just didn’t bother with that aisle.

An hour goes by I’m starting to get worried it gets to nearly two hours later with no updates and I have to ring the store. The response is the order hasn’t even been picked yet, let alone ready for collection. The only reason being they were busy! Two hours!! And that’s the excuse! And because they had accepted it and let it go through to the point it said it was wrapping the order I couldn’t cancel from my side so I had to wait for the Uber system to cancel if!

At 4.30pm a nice young man appeared apologising for the delivery time, but the driver had phoned in sick. I said no problem at all. There were only dry goods on the delivery! the young man stated that they had not put fridge/freezer items on. He stated I should only be charged for the 2 bar codes from the crates. He was going to ring his Manager to see if the missing items could be delivered on the 10pm slot. I waited, but no delivery/call. Next day i looked to find that my WHOLE delivery charge had come out of my bank account! i rang, and CS then said i will have to wait for a refund (still not received) and I have had to fork out again for another supermarket to deliver what I need.

The week before my daughter placed a click & collect order and there was 18 items not available??? Questioning this we drove to the store from Harwood/Bradshaw Bolton to complain as we looked on the shelves every product was available?? And the online grocery manager gave her the items free of charge ( which you would expect for the trouble of having to drive to the store. I said to him "" Are they kids who are picking the groceries? He said yes unfortunately sometimes they are I will have a word with them. So my delivery Sunday 13th October what could possibly go wrong ? After all the staff will be spoken to and so everything should be OK ""NO"" it wasn't, so I ordered a beef joint & a lamb joint just in case one really wasn't available as a back up for the roast dinner I was going to cook "" neither wasdelivered??? Nor the eggs or the victoria sandwich or the medallion steaks or the cheese so thinking this can't be right we again drove to the store, we went to the relevant Aisles and guess what "" EVERYTHING WAS THERE WITHIN 30 MINS OF MY DELIVERY AT HOME?????? We placed everything in a basket and asked for the Grocery online manager it wasn't the same one from last week who was really helpful and understanding this time we got the floor manager NEIL who wasn't giving me anything for my trouble or to apologise or to pay towards my petrol for the trouble??? We took pictures of everything to send to HEAD OFFICE, NEIL said the guy last week should not have given your daughter anything?? He said he would get my delivery charge refunded ?? And that was it ?? I phoned Asda customer service today and that refund was never received by the payment team ?? Obviously he had no intention of literally doing anything?? We left the store yesterday extremely annoyed at being dismissed by NEIL we gave him the basket as we wasn't prepared to pay for the items that clearly was on the shelf but the lazy picker couldn't be bothered to send with my delivery. So you might ask yourself what was done since last Sunday in a week to improve the online grocery delivery from this store ""ABSOLUTELY NOTHING "" YOU DON'T GET THIS AT TESCO, MORRISONS SAINSBURY'S ETC so NO goodwill gesture no delivery charge refund?? What an absolute disgrace ?? I asked for the managers name who is Mark the floor manager NEIL refused to give any surnames?? Odd ? Maybe the lady who comments back from the store to all reviews could pass this onto MARK the manager as I will be logging an official complaint and sending the pictures of the items that was on the shelves. If you like ASDA then do your shopping yourself go into the store or maybe choose a different Asda one that is more updated as this one isn't the best.

She had none.This happened a second time a couple of weeks later and then a day or two after that, I was bullied and banned by the security staff.I later discovered that the security guard involved was sacked by my friend, the manager of Wilkos. Knowing of our friendship, I assume she acted out of pure vindictiveness and malice towards me as a replacement for my friend who fired her.To add insult to injury Asda have not replied to any of my communications to their complaints department and continue to send me Asda card updates which I cannot, unfortunately, ban from my phone.All in all a lousy experience of a company that has demonstrated zilch integrity to a formally loyal customer.Date of experience: January 12, 2024",1

I would leave a negative number for a review if I was able to and one star is far too high for them! It started at Fuel station, went into a pump and put my card in for authorization, when authorised the pump would not release so was not usable. The pump was covered in Diesel getting it all over my hands. I then looked for paper towels in all three stations and there were not any. There were no plastic gloves in any either! I then moved to another pump and yet again got authorisation to draw fuel. I drew my fuel and at the end there was no receipt! No attendant in site. I then went into the tobacco section and Customer service in ASDA store where I came across Terry who was serving. I wanted to buy some vapes but due to poor eyesight was unable to see the flavours so I asked Terry if he could tell me what the choices were. He refused stating that he was not allowed to due to the law!! (New to me) He was unhelpful and certainly could do with a lot more training in dealing with the public. After holding up other customers whilst trying to  purchase my items I then told him about the issues at the fuel station. He was not at all interested and just didn't bother dealing with that issue. Other customers at the fuel station will be having the same experience for some time I expect. They need at least one person up there to deal with problems! What if a fire starts would dread to think what would happen then. Asda are not the cheapest fuel station and I would advise others to use another fuel station.

I was shocked by his behavior and rude attitude. This was the first time I've seen a manager behave like this. His lack of customer service was unacceptable. I believe he was discriminatory, judging people based on their dress and skin color. As a frequent shopper at Asda, I was simply looking for a battery. When I asked him politely, he rudely refused to serve me and told me to go to the counter. It seemed like he was angry because I interrupted him while he was texting. I understand they were closing at 10 pm, but as a manager, he should have responded to me politely and professionally. His behavior towards customers is completely unacceptable.

Yet the biggest fail is having asda call you an hour before your delivery is due to inform you they can't deliver your order due to staff sickness or their delivery van not working..then to be told the only way to recieve my order is to collect it myself..even if that were possible there's no mention of a refund for the delivery service I paid for.

However when I requested that the machine wouldn’t allow it. I tried multiple times to try £10 again then I tried £20 and £30 and £40. Luckily £40 worked but since I only had £50 in my account I was quite stressed about whether or not I’d be able to make the withdrawal. The ATM also wouldn’t allow me to reject the transaction so the ATM wouldn’t give me my card back either so I had no Choice but to withdraw the £40. I have never experienced anything like this before. I was also on a time limit so I didn’t have a lot of time to think everything through. There were no security guards visible to assist me either. Luckily I was able to go into the local town centre to NatWest to put the £40 back in and then withdraw the £10 I originally wanted but this whole problem made me late for an appointment elsewhere too. Won’t be using an Asda ATM again.Date of experience: October 09, 2024",1

To make matters worse, Klarna informed me that the merchant, Asda, had actually confirmed the order—despite the fact that I received no confirmation or goods.Their customer service has been absolutely appalling. I’ve sent multiple emails, and they barely reply—maybe once a week, if that. Calling them is even worse; it takes forever to get through to someone, and even when you finally do, it’s not helpful at all. In desperation, I even tried messaging them on Twitter to get a response from someone, but still nothing.I started this process nearly a month ago, and despite sending emails, making phone calls, and trying social media, I still have no resolution.

465,Asda,Giuseppe,GB,"Oct 3, 2024","I've been an Asda customer for over…I've been an Asda customer for over five years and frequently shop online for home delivery. While I've encountered some issues along the way, most have been resolved quickly. However, I've recently faced a concerning problem: this is the second time in a month that my frozen items have arrived completely defrosted.Typically, the delivery driver arrives early and often leaves my groceries outside my door before I can even greet them. I'm beginning to wonder if there's an incentive for drivers to deliver quickly, as this seems to compromise the quality of my food. If that's the case, Asda should consider implementing measures to encourage drivers to ensure items are delivered properly and in good condition.My main concern is that if my frozen items are defrosted, they may have been left outside of the fridge for over an hour. This raises a significant question: Should I feel safe consuming these items and the fridge ones, or is it best to throw them away? Clear guidance on this matter would be greatly appreciated, as it's a major concern for customers who rely on the quality and safety of their orders.Date of experience: October 02, 2024",1

We unloaded our shopping on the car park and I took the trolly to the nearest trolly station, but I didn't use it as it didn't have a trolly with a chain in it and as we all know the chain releases the £1 coin we pay as a deposit. I looked at another 3 trolly stations - all had no chains. So I and my medical conditions pushed the trolly back to the store (about 50 yards each way). I asked the trolly collector on the way why there weren't any chains in them and he said store orders! I spoke the manager and asked him how much they make from the scheme. He said we don't make anything from it, it all goes to charity. So there you have it, admission of an ongoing problem for over 12 months-ever since the £1 deposit was introduced and I can vouch for that as it has happened to us many times in the past. Usually I just leave the trolly as I suspect many others also do, But today I just thought sod it why should I give away £1 just to shop here AGAIN.As for it all goes to charity, which charity? when? How do I know EVERY £1 does go to charity.               If someone wants to donate to a charity let them decide which and when.ASDA. I've shopped in this store since the first day it opened don't make it harder for us to shop with.

Received an email with items missing/substitute list in the morning. Tons of stuff missing altogether, basic things like burger buns, ketchup and many more - hardly ostrich steaks or beluga caviar. Many other items are subbed. Yes, for the same price and similar enough items, BUT all the subs are less in weight than the original items. So I'm paying the same, but getting less stuff? I don't think so.Anyway, the order is useless, I'll have to re-order everything from Tesco. Called Asda customer service to cancel. My order wasn't being picked or 'on the road' at that time. After some waiting they assured me that the order is cancelled and my refund will be with me in 48 hours. Great! Or so I thought.Received a notification just now: my order is on the way to me. Futhermore, it was supposed to be delivered 9-10pm, Asda themselves changed it to 7:45pm with no explanation or anything. And obviously, the call centre guy lied, my order is not cancelled. Well, I'm not going to accept it and will never ever shop with Asda again.

I did this for two of the items but didn’t  receive any confirmation. By 8pm (delivered 5pm) I looked online to check how the process works but couldn’t find the answer.  No refund was showing on my order so I clicked to request a refund. I then had an email to confirm the request had been received. 2 minutes later another saying it was being processed and 2 minutes after that saying it hadn’t been approved! No reason given. I called customer service and did get the refund thankfully.  Then a couple of days later (well within the 5 day limit) a travel mug I’d had in the same order had a problem with the lid. I requested a refund and explained the problem. The refund was immediately rejected. I sent a detailed email as to what was wrong with the mug and asked why the refund was instantly rejected but haven’t had a reply yet. I will be phoning customer services but I’ve never experienced such bad customer service and refund problems with any other grocery delivery. I would not recommend Asda and will not use them again.

516,Asda,Gallifray Falls,GB,"Updated Sep 28, 2024","Moronic substitutions, orchestrated fraudMoronic substitutions of main ingredients in meals like pasta, veg, meat-free food substituted with meat, and other assorted cluelessness. Don't know if stock is coming from the Brighton Marina branch or the Hallingbury branch. Numerous times they have swapped out asda own brand for expensive branded items which cost the same but have half the weight, so paying more for less.   It happens too often to be random, it's clearly orchestrated.  For example they had no Asda 12 large eggs, so they replaced it with 12 small eggs of some random brand I've never heard of before but were dearer. End result is paying the price for large Asda eggs and getting priced match 12 small eggs.    That's fraud. Having had enough I rejected the entire order at the doorstep for the 2nd time in 3 months. I hope it costs them. There won't be a 3rd. Tesco have always been a little dearer on the home delivery, but they actually send you what you wanted, or price match a superior product as a substitute. In Asda it's impossible to do a food shop without a litany of completely absent or poorly substituted items.  Overall Asda are unprofessional, unable to provide basic services which are the foundation of home delivery, and provide massive inconvenience in every shop.They are untenable as a home grocery delivery company with the constant misery of delivery drivers who clearly don't want to be there, and in store the staff either seem completely miserable or completely exhausted and defeated.  In the ASDA Brighton Marina a few months ago I was doing my shopping with the scan and go device. Every time I got to checkout a really miserable member of staff would start punching his fist into my carefully packed shopping (in my own reusable and canvas bags as if they were his private property) and ripped out random products to scan as a security check. He did it to every bag and destroyed numerous items in the process as well as throwing heavy items like a bag of 2kg potatoes back in on top of eggs, bursting packets of crisps open by throwing in a 1kg tub of peanut butter. What a cretinous excuse for a worker. His camp and angry attitude came across as if I had spat in his face or insulted his mother. Scan and go at Brighton Marina treats people as criminals every time out to steal their stock as their default view of customers using it. It's as if none of them want to offer scan and go but are forced to offer it, and so will make it as difficult and unpleasant for the customers to use as possible in the hope they won't use it in future.  He's done it repeatedly on the few monthly food shops we trailed it so we stopped the scan and go and went back to the disaster that is home delivery. We now use Tesco in Hove on Church road. Not a single substituted item was delivered, bulk buy of larger items (like squash, toilet paper etc) all adhered to. It was a breath of fresh air. Like for like it cost around 4% more, and I would rather pay 4% more than have missing ingredients in 80% of my from-scratch meals. I think what ASDA needs is to bring in the administrators, get rid of all the staff who don't want to be there from shelf stackers to area managers, and have someone else buy it who understands that this isn't America and ASDA isn't Walmart. The attitude of many staff seems to be one which will only be resolved by firing them, as they clearly hate their jobs, hate the public, and would rather just continue hating their job and subjecting everyone else to their poor life decis9ions, and instead find a role they would either excel at, or get them away from direct contact with customers of the business. We wrote a recorded delivery letter to the store manager at the Marina who didn't even bother responding. It seems even the manager doesn't want to be in their job and hates having to work with members of the public or established customers. Don't shop at ASDA, they'll make you pay dearly.

522,Asda,Gemma Williams/Joyce,GB,"Sep 26, 2024","Embarrassingly dreadful service I have been shopping with Asda most weeks for years, if anybody at Asda actually reads my comments you only need to look at my account to see the evidence of this. Like any busy working mother, I occasionally need to do a same day shop for items that I have run out of. I don't like to use other retailers on Uber as I do not agree with the inflated prices of everyday groceries therefore I use the express delivery slots on my Asda groceries account. I can honestly say that this has gone wrong more times than it has gone right. My shop almost never arrives during my allotted time slot and is often significantly later. I pay a premium of £8.50 for this service as I have no time to go to the supermarket after work. This means that I am often left without essential items when I have done a shop for these items with arguably the most well known brand in the UK for groceries. I always ring to advise of my woe and I am always greeted with a call handler at an Indian call centre; I can say that some of your representatives that I have spoken to are very competent but most are not and they have been trained to be empathetic and say things like ""I Understand Gemma"" repeatedly. I spoke to a chap yesterday who confirmed that they always get lots of calls from customers that have used the Uber delivery service and he said the system does not work... why on earth do you offer a service that you cannot fulfill without flaws? I also have given the click and collect service a go and this is often much worse, the store at Rooley Lane often close the door as they are swarmed by UberEats drivers and one day I came to the store 3 times to collect my order and gave up in the end. As a well known brand that makes significant shareholder profits; you really should invest some of this into making your services better as my multiple experiences with you have been appalling.Date of experience: September 25, 2024",1

No offer to refund part or all of the postage or do anything by way of an apology when I called them to investigate the missing item.Go to their competitors - Ocado Sainsbury’s, Tesco, deliveries are all far superior and care about customer experience. Ocado recently couldn't do more when part of a small order I made was unavailable - called, emailed, messaged, sent multiple apology discounts and emails. That’s customer service Asda is disgusting - it doesn’t deserve to stay in business.Date of experience: September 20, 2024",1

I am unwell and have just come back from a trip so didn’t want to go out and so just paid the £8.99 delivery charge.At just gone 12 the order tracker was still showing as order being prepared. I tried to call customer services, after 8 mins on hold I gave up and tried to ring the store direct but didn’t realise it just sends you back to the generic customer services.After another 10 mins on hold someone answered. She told me there was an issue with these express orders and I should wait until 1pm and if it hasn’t arrived by then, I should assume it’s not coming. She advised me she cannot contact the store. I wasn’t happy with this, why I am calling customer services who can’t speak to the store to find out what is going on? I asked her this and also advised her I’m not waiting any longer. The call then disconnected, conveniently.I decided to just go to the store myself, my shopping was sitting there ready but I was advised the service with Uber eats who deliver their express deliveries was down. Why was there no update? Can nobody pick up a phone or email to keep people updated?The gentleman in store who gave me my order said I should take the issue up with Uber eats. Uber eats are not the problem, Asda and the lack of communication are the problem. Then I was advised the way to make a complaint is to call the customer services phone number. Like I don’t have better things to do than keep waiting on hold. I also don’t want to speak to someone in a call centre who doesn’t give a crap.There is no clear guidelines on the Asda website on how to complain.

612,Asda,Neil,GB,"Sep 13, 2024"," ASDA opticians ThornabyI bought two pair of glasses from ASDA opticians in Thornaby. I had a prescription from elsewhere which I was told wouldn't be a problem. There was deal for a second pair of glasses for 50% price. I picked two frames one for varifocals and another for tinted varifocals. I had to go back in for the manager to check my prescription before they put the order in. When I went to pick them up a few weeks later one pair was fine but the tinted pair weren't, I couldn't read fine type. First the manager tried to blame my prescription but I pointed out both pairs were supposed to be the same prescription and he had checked it before ordering. Then he said both pair were the same and it was impossible they couldn't be. I found his attitude exasperating and pointed out I could read with one pair but not the other so they couldn't be the same. Rather than remake the lenses he insisted there was nothing wrong so all he could do was lift the lens. I had little choice but to except this so they were sent of to be changed. I kept the good ones. Two weeks later the new ones arrived. I could read with them now but the long vision was blurred because of the alteration. In the end I just asked him to give me another pair with the same frame that had decent lenses. So I didn't get the second frame and felt let down. I'm sure the first pair were just faulty and if remade they would have been fine. I wont use them again.Date of experience: July 01, 2024",1

Due to arrive between 6 and 8 but never arrived, but showing as delivered on app. Phoned customer services who told me delivery running late, 8 more before is. At 10 pm it still hadn't arrived, phoned customer services - they couldn't tell me where it was. Delivery driver had my number (left in notes for delivery) but no call or update. Over £200 worth of food not delivered. Another call to customer services the following morning- told me order couldn't be delivered now and offered a full refund and £5 compensation! I explained this didn't cover us having to buy a takeaway for tea, and breakfast items at the local shop the next morning and a 40 minute drive (both directions) to asda the next day (on the first day of our holiday) to buy the food we had ordered. Called customer services again to escalate complaint after previously being told I'd get a call back within 48 hours (didn't happen). Again promised a call back in 48 hours (didn't happen) and offered another £5 voucher. I have no idea where these vouchers are - in my app apparently. There is no email address or chat function for customer services or address to write complaints to. All you can do is phone customer services who read their apologies from a script, clearly have no interaction with the stores, offer measly compensation and make false promises about calling you back.I am absolutely appalled with my experience and will not ordering from asda again.Date of experience: August 17, 2024",1

For a time all was ok. However, over the last few months orders have routinely been missing items - the driver has said that they haven't been loaded onto the van, so they are ""nil picks"" whatever that means. However, according to my emails the items were included with my shopping, and I of course was charged for them the day before the order was even sent. This has happened again this evening, four items missing from the delivery, despite the email I received advising me that there were no items that hadn't been sent (I had 2 substitute items, but no non deliveries). The driver then didn't bother to mark my order as delivered, so I couldn't even request a refund from the online Asda site.We all make mistakes, I get that, but with Asda this is now happening far too often. As a result of tonights delivery myself and my son had to spend additional money that we don't have on food for our dinner, as those items hadn't been delivered.There is no way to make an online complaint that I am aware of - the customer services email address isn't monitored and it just bounces back. I emailed the CEO and he appears to have just ignored my concerns as I have heard nothing.This really isn't fair - if you take my money for items, then I expect to receive them, and at the very least to be able to request my money back if there is a problem.I may now take my business elsewhere.This may not be the case with all Asda stores, but certainly the Harrogate branch has on quite a few occasions now, messed my orders up.As a side note, I have eventually been able to request a refund - but this still doesn't change the fact that I am consistently getting poor service with my deliveries - and there is no way for me to log an official complaint with Asda that I am aware of.Date of experience: September 09, 2024",1

The air machine malfunctioned, in that it seemed to refuse to blow air into one of our tyres - it all just seemed to leak round the valve instead. Simultaneously, though, as I continued to try, it displayed some wildly fluctuating pressures, some of which massively exceeded the maximum for out tyre. Since I didn't think air was going in, I just assumed that those numbers were a sign of the machine having a senior moment. In the end we gave up, did it at a different garage, and then went on our way. Quarter of an hour later we had a blowout, whilst doing 70mph on the M6. Of course I can't demonstrate cause and effect, which is the only reason I'm not billing ASDA for my tyre, and suing them for endangerment. But we did go back to warn them that the machine might be faulty, and got the very casual response that they've known for some time, and a service request has gone in.

In the last two orders, we’ve been charged for missing and unavailable items, and their customer service has been utterly useless in resolving the issue.I’ve called the helpline for three days in a row, only to be told repeatedly that the issue is being escalated, with no action taken. The excuse was that the driver didn’t mark the delivery as delivered. If that's the case, we should have received a refund for the entire order, but instead of accepting their mistake and refunding us for the missing items, they’ve done nothing but waste time.This is absolute daylight robbery. After being a loyal customer for years, I’m shocked by this level of service and will no longer be shopping with Asda.

Such a statement must have been written by head office to allow the company to fob off customers as it does not take into account any aspect of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and the fact that goods must be ""fit for purpose and last a reasonable length of time"". It can be summed up as the followingThe Consumer Rights Act 2015 is a guarantee for the consumer against poor workmanship and misrepresentation for a period of time during the life expectancy of that product, which should be no more than 6 years in the UK.The Consumer Rights Act 2015, Section 23:132 protects consumers in situations such as these. According to this section, You have the right to insist on the repair or replacement of faulty goods, with the costs borne by the trader. Additionally, any costs associated with the removal and reinstallation of the replacement should be covered by the trader.

Another lady appears and asked me if I needed help, I explained I wanted to speak to a manager, when asked I told her it was to do with lack of stock. She asked me not to be rude, which was totally wrong, but is the go to response in my experience of a weak assistant. I have now been waiting about 15 minutes.

So I pay for a delivery I would have otherwise cancelled if given the option!!Anyway, I leave it 4x days, I can see they still have the offer on and undeniably it was a good offer, still showing in stock, so gave it another punt.

I tried to go to their website to speak to someone about what I believe is completely unfair practice. If you can't provide over half the customer's shopping basket, they should have an opportunity to cancel, shouldn't they!?But to no avail, you are stuck on a loop with AI and no option to speak to a human. You can put in refund requests, but I'm not talking about a refund for items I didn't receive, I'm talking about the fact that Asda promotions pull many buyers in, but if they're not getting these promotions due to stock availability, then the customer is ultimately worse off because maybe all that's left in the basket afterwards, is full price items people can get cheaper elsewhere!Never, ever again.

When I arrived I called the phone number provided on the sign, gave my name and was made to wait 20 minutes for someone to appear. When they did appear they still asked our name and continued to take even longer then finding our order. Once home, we found that a huge chunk of items were missing so we contacted the store to let them know. We were told to contact customer service to get each item refunded. This took an extremely long time having to spell out each item that was missing. We were then told the items would be refunded the way we paid, we paid a mixture of gift card and my bank card. After a week we found no refund had been made, instead they refunded us our money via evouchers. These evouchers restrict me from buying baby formula, a main staple item in our house with a newborn baby. After numerous unhelpful phone calls from Asda and awaiting contact to help we got told there's nothing we can do. They've essentially taken our money, made a mistake and refunded it in a restricted way that doesn't allow us to buy food for our newborn. The customer service has been disgraceful, waiting days for replies. I've even supplied my phone number but noone will bother calling to help. The lack of help and empathy is disgusting.

729,Asda,TW,GB,"Updated Aug 27, 2024","If you're disabled, use a different supermarket! I'm incredibly disappointed with Asda's online grocery service and their shockingly poor customer service. I encountered an issue with their online checkout, which prevented me from securing a delivery slot, despite having a delivery pass. I urgently needed the delivery for an important celebration, but Asda provided no help or resolution.I contacted Asda multiple times, only to be met with either no response or inadequate replies. As a disabled customer who relies on home deliveries, this situation caused significant distress, forced me to make costly last-minute arrangements, and ruined important personal events. To make matters worse, I was left without a delivery service for three weeks, which added even more stress and inconvenience.After a decade of spending an average of £70 a week with Asda, they chose to lose me as a customer rather than refund the £6.50 I paid for a delivery pass, despite their obvious service failure. Their complete lack of accountability and poor handling of my complaint have left me frustrated and angry. I also have serious doubts about the authenticity of their customer service representative, Jamie. To this day, I'm not convinced that ""Jamie"" isn't just an AI program—more like ""jAIme""—given how robotic and unhelpful the responses were.I'm now with a competitor that not only shows up on time but actually delivers what I ordered—unlike Asda, who think it's acceptable to replace non-alcoholic beer with alcohol. I strongly advise anyone considering using Asda's services to think twice. Their customer service is non-existent, and they clearly do not care about their customers, especially those who are vulnerable. Avoid at all costs.Date of experience: July 25, 2024",1

I was told that it hadn't been received from the suppliers so no it wouldn't arrive but would be there soon!!! I said this was no good as I need the pans so I'd like a full refund so I can go in store to buy. I was told they can't do that as they have to cancel the order with the supplier first and then issue a refund once the supplier accepts the cancellation which could take up to 2 weeks but as a goodwill gesture she would refund the postage charge! I said that was no good to me and I wish to make a complaint to which she said she was the department for complaints but she can't help! Checked online and no complaints department, tried sending DM on FB but colleagues just fobbed me off saying they're aware there's an issue and my order will arrive soon, the DM I sent asking where I can send a complaint was ignored, tried several different numbers but all go through to same place and can find no email address that works. Tried calling one last time (on hold again for 40 minutes) only to be told I have to allow 48 hours from today for order to arrive before I can do anything, asked to speak to somebody to make a complaint and again told I'm speaking to the correct department but they can't help. Told them I'm going to go to Trading Standards as this is not acceptable - they've taken money for goods they can't supply and are refusing to refund the money.

I questioned the funds applied for from my bank £71.10, told because the delivery failed no funds had been taken. The customer service advisor got shirty saying I did not know what I was talking about. On Tuesday 20th August confirmed by my bank £71.10 had been taken by ASDA. So now I'm having to get bank to chase ASDA. The delivery failed because your driver had finished deliveries in area early, no van break down andd to that customer service advisor, ASDA did take the funds out my account, so YOU don't know what your talking about. ASDA has taken funds from my account without providing the goods, so the contract between us was broken by ASDA and you stole my money as it's in your account and not mine. I don't come to your stores, take goods and not pay. Asda has in fact done the same, taken money from my account without providing goods to the value of money taken.

Went upstairs the following day I receive a text message saying there's been a substitution which I hadn't noticed turns out they've replaced something I can't eat for something I'm extremely allergic to, requested a refund. Instantly declined as the refund was requested the following day yet that's when I was made aware there was a substitution.

I stopped using Asda previously due to the lack of staffed checkouts and the insatiable thirst they have to FORCE us all onto self service. Wow, it was worse than before with only 3 staffed checkouts and long queues to get served. I just left the trolly and went to Lidl instead.      As I left I wanted to fill up with petrol but they have even stopped putting staff in the filling station. Needless to say, I went to a local independent supplier instead.     Asda, are you just trying to drive your customers away? I certainly won't be back, and this shows why Asda are now the only one of the big four supermarkets who are losing market share.

After answering him with a no it's my own I bring, looked at me like I had stood in something,  he then went on to say you can't bring small trolleys in to here as you need to go to checkouts, me looking around saw at least 4 other trolleys where I was. I said to him that you only 1 till open, and que of 6 people waiting to be served on it, I had frozen items that in the heat would of been melted by the time I had got home, he then decided it was ok to continue to argue with my misses and me about  we ain't got the staff to open tills etc, all the people without jobs and they can't employ people to man the tills it's a joke. There were 3 elderly couples in that que who looked so hot and were visably destressed having to wait.

Which genius decided you should deliver food in those little green trays bagless like some poor bloke that's been tied to a lamp post and debagged on his stag do? I don't know if you know much about stairs but it's a bit inconvenient to take the items out of your little trays and carry them up. In what is supposed to take the hassle out of actually going to the shop turns out to be more hassle and a dash against time to make sure your cornettos don't melt by the time you get them to the freezer because you have to carry all your shopping by hand up a flight of stairs.

First of all I can't fault the drivers who are always pleasant, friendly and helpful.  Now for the cons - First, unlike other supermarkets who take the money after they have delivered, Asda actually take the money more than 24 hours before the delivery is due which means you then have to wait for refunds for missing items or subs you don't want.  2. When I started ordering with them it was relatively easy to contact customer service if anything was wrong - this has become more complicated and takes longer.3. On this last occasion I had absolutely no notification from Asda about the delivery (usually you get a text and an email which tells you what's missing or subbed).  I wasn't even sure the driver would be coming and it's far too frustrating trying to contact anyone.  Two items were missing, both of which were important and if I had received an email or text to notify me I could have gone out to a local shop to replace these items.On a final note, the rewards look good on the face of it, but the 'missions' are ridiculous and the star buys are usually not relevant to me.Overall I feel the service has gone down to a level where I will not be using Asda for home delivery again.Date of experience: August 14, 2024",3

Although my deliveries are usually well within the slot time, sometimes earlier and drivers are usually polite, friendly and helpful, I am finding that I am often having to go shopping to buy the bits that were not available or substituted with an unacceptable item; often basic items are ‘unavailable’, surely something as simple as a loaf of bread could be substituted? I would have thought when accepting substitutes there should be no such thing as an unavailable item, unless it’s something more specific with little variation. When substitutes are provided they are often nothing like the unavailable item.

The security guard said that my son stole ice cream and ate it. My son did not have time to explain the whole situation and was accused of theft.  I was forced to pay £8.50 for two packets of ice cream. Then I talked to my son, and he said that his card was declined at one register, so he went to the other one and paid. I checked my bank account, and it was charged twice for ice cream at Asda Colchester at the same time. I went back to the store and talked to the lady who stopped my son and the security guard. They checked the camera monitoring again and said that my son had paid. The lady very rudely gave me the money back. I feel angry about this, and they hurt my son very much.  I am deeply sorry; I will never shop at Asda again and I will describe the whole issue on social media at my earliest convenience.  Me and my family are on holiday in the Colchester area, and we have never ever encountered an issue like this.

854,Asda,Lisa,GB,"Aug 9, 2024","Avoid Asda Chaucer Road Sheffield I've been using Asda delivery from the Chaucer Road, Sheffield store for several years now, and unfortunately, the service has been steadily declining week by week. What started as a convenient option has become increasingly frustrating.Firstly, the quality of the substitutions has become laughable. Items that are nowhere near comparable to what I've ordered are being sent as replacements, showing a complete lack of care and consideration. It feels like the staff simply can't be bothered to put in any effort when picking out alternatives as well as just throwing them in to break.The rising prices are another concern. It's no secret that grocery prices have gone up everywhere, but it seems particularly bad with Asda. To make matters worse, as prices soar, the quality of the food has noticeably dropped. Fresh produce doesn't last as long, and items often arrive looking less than fresh. It's disappointing to see the standards slip so drastically.Overall, Asda's delivery service from Chaucer Road is becoming more of a hassle than a help. I really hope they can address these issues, but for now, I'm seriously considering taking my business elsewhere.Date of experience: August 09, 2024",1

866,Asda,Alex Mc,GB,"Aug 7, 2024","Is this service worth using?I had a really frustrating experience with my recent online order. I've been a regular customer for a couple of years, but this time, things went wrong.Last Thursday, I placed an order to be delivered to my flat. I received a message confirming the delivery time between 20:30 & 21:30. Since I have a large dog and for safety reasons, I usually meet the driver outside on the street. When I got a text saying my delivery was next, I went downstairs at 20:58. However, by 21:10, the driver hadn't arrived, so I went back up to my flat as I couldn't get internet access from the street. At 21:10, I received a message that the driver was outside, but when I went back out, no one was there. I waited until 21:30, but still no sign of the driver, so I went back inside, deciding to wait for the driver to call me before going outside again.I received a message that the driver was running late and would arrive by 22:00 hrs. At 22:00, I got a message that the driver was on his way and would be with me ASAP. Since I usually go to bed early and needed to get up at 03:00, I checked my messages again, and it still said the driver was on the way. Frustrated, I called an emergency contact number I found for ASDA and was told that my order had been cancelled. I was very annoyed as I had been waiting outside for over half an hour despite the message indicating that my order was on its way. I was offered a new delivery time for Friday at 16:30–17:00 and was assured that I wouldn't be charged for delivery. I had to log back into my account and authorize payment again, but the lady assisting me had set up the delivery free of charge.However, when I checked my account on Friday at about 14:00, it said that my order had been delivered the previous day at 22:00. This led me to call the emergency number again, and a male operator told me to log into my account and pay again. This was very frustrating as I had already gone through the payment process, and it seemed that the previous lady had not sorted out my delivery as promised.So, I went through the authorization and payment process again and finally organized delivery for the earliest slot this morning (Saturday). I paid again and went through bank confirmation once more. When I checked my bank account, I found that the bank was holding two payments for my shopping, and there was an additional £5 delivery charge on my bill.My shopping finally arrived, but there were some substitutes I was not happy with, so I returned them. There were also 5 broken eggs in the box. I also noticed that a refund had been made to my account.I ordered vitamin E tablets at £2.50, but I received vitamin D, for which I was only charged £1.50. I returned the vitamin D, but the refund I received was only £1.07, which was incorrect.The original order number was 77924557000465, with a total balance of £140.67. However, the order that arrived today was 7802420001485 and had an added £5 delivery charge, despite being told it would be free. There were a couple of amendments, and the total bill came to £151.54.I called and confirmed my delivery time, but my bank is showing three payments for you - £144.19, £8.15, and £140.69, totalling £293.03. Also, I received an ASDA refund to my account for £0.02, which was unclear to me. This whole experience has been frustrating and inconvenient, especially considering the long wait times and multiple payment issues.I complained directly to Asad on their emergency number, the guy gave me a customer service email address to complain to, I spent about an hour putting my complaint together to find the email address was no longer valid. (Hmm, Why would customer service cancel their email address? )Too many complaints, maybe?But for my half an hour waiting outside, 4 hours waiting for my orders to be delivered, Asda did say I could have £5 off my next online order.We will see, they said I could have free delivery, but I got charged for it.The term Indian Givers comes to mind, (Sorry, any younger readers will have to look that phrase up.)Date of experience: August 01, 2024",1

868,Asda,Jess Beard,GB,"Aug 7, 2024","Asda Crawley ~ Shockingly Abysmal Home Delivery Service & Customer ServiceAsda's home delivery service is not even worthy of 1 star. I had been ordering Asda home deliveries since June last year, and my previous experience last week is certainly going to be my final experience with them. Before I chose Asda, I used to order shopping from Tesco, which I never had any issues with. However, due to the cost of living skyrocketing in recent years, I opted to try shopping with Asda as I found their products significantly cheaper. Big mistake!Their product availability is abysmal ~ only one occasion in the last year where they actually had all of the items in my shopping with 0 substitutes. Not only that, but their constant substitutions were poor. One time, I ordered an aubergine, they sent me a cucumber instead… on another occasion I ordered a grout pen and they sent me a super glue pen… both completely irrelevant/significant items! Every time I ordered a delivery, I was always emailed a few days after the order asking to give feedback. I constantly responded to them and stated that their product availability was awful but clearly was a waste of time because nothing changed. They don't listen to their customers. Their payments for home deliveries are completely backwards. They take money out the day before the order arrives, and then if products are unavailable and/or the substitutes are no good, then waiting for a refund took somewhere between 3-5 days… basically they are quick to take the money out but when you require the money back? Different story entirely.When something goes wrong and you contact Asda, the level of service is mostly atrocious. It is a common pattern that they are unapologetic, unwilling to help and they do not resolve issues unless you ring them several times and chase them up.Last year September, I was due a home delivery and the delivery driver rung me during my delivery slot to say my delivery was cancelled due to their van breaking down, which was frustrating however I get these things happen sometimes. The driver was very unapologetic and blasé about the whole ordeal, he asked if I could come out and collect it ~ I don't drive plus I live a 15-20 minute drive away; I explained this to him. He also asked if I knew of anybody else that could collect it, at this time I explained to him that if I was a driver then I wouldn't even be ordering a home delivery service and I wouldn't be paying extra for a delivery fee… He also told me that somebody would be in touch with me the following day to reschedule the delivery. Surprise surprise - nobody contacts me. So I ring Asda, to which they tell me that I in fact have to reschedule the delivery. So I arranged for the same day, I had to pay yet another delivery charge in which I was told I would have it refunded as I had to pay a higher delivery fee, of no fault of my own! So my shopping arrives, I then asked the delivery driver if he knew how long it would be before I would receive a refund for the rescheduled delivery fee. He very abruptly told me to ring customer service and that he couldn't help me. Completely unnecessary and uncalled for. As I was packing away my shopping, I noticed that one of my fridge items was 2 days out of date and as the delivery driver had already gone at this point, I once again rung Asda. I explained the situation and they apologised, though their apology came off very disingenuous, sadly like a lot of their customer service advisors. I feel like they aren't actually sorry that I'm having an issue, I feel like they're only saying sorry because it's their job to say it.There's been other poor delivery experiences, where they have turned up much earlier than the time allocated on multiple occasions. They have delivered crates where products have carelessly packed at the store, and so have been damaged or spilled in the process. In those instances I've had to spend more time cleaning up than actually packing the damn items away. Some of the drivers genuinely stink. There was one occasion where I didn't want a substitute, was told that I would have it refunded, however never received an email or any confirmation so had to call up Asda and chase up.Final straw was last week I ordered a home delivery and it never turned up. I rung Asda and explained the situation. I was told I would receive an email 24-48 hours later from the credit team. Still no response nearly 48 hours later, I ring Asda again. Was told exactly the same thing as the first person. Nearly 48 hours later I finally receive an email to say sorry if I haven't got the order but afraid they can't process my refund as my order was marked ""correctly delivered to me"" by Martin. I rung Asda for a third time and they finally agreed to refund me the full amount. The sheer audacity of them trying to take nearly £60 from me is SHAMEFUL. If you want an easy and non headache-inducing shop, then avoid Asda like the plague. Date of experience: August 02, 2024",1

No alternative address was offered. This issue was at the Asda in Dewsbury store, West Yorkshire. Good Evening, I am emailing you to raise a serious complaint regarding the service I received this morning in the Dewsbury store. I have been using an Asda reloadable shopping card for a couple of years but since the new tills were installed I have had problems using my card. Today this issue caused me severe anxiety and embarrassment. I packed my shopping, scanned my reward card and handed over my shopping card to pay for my groceries. The cashier tapped the card but nothing happened so she tapped it again. She then informed me my card had nothing on it. I explained I use the card weekly and top it up every  month so there was definitely a credit balance on my card. She tried it again then pressed for a manager to attend. We waited but got no response so she called him again. Then she asked the lady on the till in front for help. The cashier finished with her customer then came around to assist. She mentioned this issue had happened before and showed the teller how to get the balance on the screen. They did this and then informed me the balance was showing as 1p. I said again this was incorrect. The teller tried for a 3rd time to call the manager but because he was not wearing his headset the call was again ignored. By this time the queue was beginning to get longer and I was getting more upset, so much so that I began to suffer a panic attack. I got my bank card out and said I would pay that way instead. The teller said I shouldn't have to when there was credit on my shopping card. She called for the manager again but he did not respond. The teller infront suggested trying the card one more time and low and behold the screen showed a credit balance of over £51. I paid for my shopping and apologised to the customer behind me for taking so long to get sorted. As I left the store shaking I walked past the manager who was laughing with a colleague and still not wearing the headset. If I had not been in such a state I would have said something but I couldn't. Due to this incident I had to take a betablocker to ease the panic attack and stop the shaking to enable me to drive home. I have not had to do this for a few weeks and I am very angry that I had to take a tablet today because of the anxiety caused by something that was not my fault. This is not the first incident using my shopping card but it is definitely the worst. I would appreciate it if you could get your tills sorted out so I do not have to go through this embarrassment again.Date of experience: August 04, 2024",1

I asked if they could rebook my order for the following morning, they said no without another payment (my shopping was just over £100.) I explained that I didn’t have another £100, we’re in a cost of living crisis and I spent the last of my money on my shopping. They said there was nothing they could do but they’d refunded me and it would be with me in 3-5 working days (it’s Friday and this means that I’m likely to get my refund in a week’s time, which means I have no food shopping and no money for a week?)

It seems I somehow signed up for a free month's trial, of which I had no knowledge.  I managed to get reimbursed by this company only to find that by putting in an order with Asda around 5 January of this year I had agreed to pay this monthly amount when the trial ended.I then wrote to the head of Asda. It was very difficult to extract the name of the top person, who I found is a Lord Stuart Rose.  I wrote to him on 14 June and never got a reply.  Somehow I didn't expect one.I would urge customers to scrutinise their bank statements very carefully on a regular basis as some people make a lot of small purchases and sums like this are easy to miss.  Also, if you don't get paper statements, like we are encouraged, the amounts will be even easier to miss.Shame on Asda for signing up to this scam but judging by some of the reviews I have been reading, I am not surprised.

Very rude driver. Not good for a public facing role. If we had been out he would have had to wait or come back as he was so early. He didn’t give us chance to even get to the front door, he was already unloading the trays. He didn’t even know we was in ! Hardly said a word. I knew I had some substitutions so I was expecting him to ask. Normally the drivers ask if you want to keep them or send them back. Nothing from him.,Once the trays were empty, he just ok ? Walked off back to van and drove off. If I get this service again I will find another store and get my online shopping from them. Plenty to choose from. I work in a public facing job and if I treated people like that I would have a lot to answer for by my Manager. Not a happy customer ! If the review stars would allow I would not highlight any !

938,Asda,Daniel Mason,GB,"Jul 28, 2024","Left for a hour at reception and staff not able to helpI was doing a large shop for charity and asked for some help from a member of staff to help me buy large quantities. The staff members then kept coming from different departments and nobody could help and asked another person to come instead. They couldn’t help and I was then basically just left there for an hour waiting for someone to come who had any level of authority to help put in a large order. In the end I just left and resigned myself to a large manual shop, which was 11 visits taking over an hour per visit. On 1 occasion I used scan and go as I thought it may be easier, as I had 6 products with 50+ cans of each. The app is horribly slow and then the quality check wanted to scan 48 items. By comparison I also had to do a similar shop with Sainsbury’s at the same time and the staff were nothing but accommodating, as they were empowered to help people. The experience was comparably effortless and I was in and out in within 20 Minutes per shop. Put simply, I will never ever go through the doors of Asda again, as you do not invest in your people.

They put me through to Weston-Super-Mare and I spoke to the night manager. He also had no idea about my order and could not help. What sort of company are you when NOBODY knows whats going on.

We all have some bad experiences with supermarkets. I don't think the overall scores for Asda are reflective of the service so I gave 3 stars for the store but I have to point out that Asda have bee  absolutely ripping us all off with the petrol. I mu town of frome Asda and sainsburys have been operating a tacit cartell by not competing and for the last 3 years have elevated the cost of petrol much higher than in surrounding towns. I have complained to each company who just say they check the market. Thing is they are the market here and they cheat. So you say, it's only a few pence on a.litre. well I work out they have fleeced £400,000 a year extra from us on petrol alone. The competitions agency do nothing. So if you think Asda does all it can in a cost of living crisis think again. Down load the petrol price app to find the best deals and don't assume Asda is doing you favours on petrol.

952,Asda,Fatima Chughtai,GB,"Jul 27, 2024","Rude ‘manager’I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with the service I received at your Monmouth North fuel station on 27/7/24. The incident not only caused significant delay and inconvenience whilst I was already running short of time, but also resulted in undue embarrassment due to the behavior of one of your staff members.Upon arriving at the fuel station, I followed the usual procedure to fill my vehicle. However, before leaving I was abruptly and rather rudely interrupted by a staff member, Lucy, who accused me of not paying the correct about of money. Despite my attempts to explain and clarify the situation, the staff member continued to argue in an extremely rude and dismissive manner.I paid £79 for fuel at the checkout. However, the ‘manager’ Lucy incorrectly claimed that I had only paid £43 and insisted that I needed to pay an additional amount. Despite my assurance that I had paid the correct amount, the staff member continued to argue with me in an aggressive and confrontational manner. To resolve the dispute, I checked my bank statement and provided evidence that I had indeed paid £79.Rather than acknowledging her mistake, she falsely accused me of paying at the wrong till because she claimed I had stated the wrong till number. This accusation was completely unfounded and highly unprofessional. When I was finally refunded £73 to rectify the payment error, the cashier was unable to provide me with a refund receipt, adding to my frustration and inconvenience.The entire episode caused an unnecessary delay, leaving other customers visibly frustrated and creating an uncomfortable scene. I felt embarrassed and humiliated by the unwarranted attention and the accusatory tone used by your employee. To exacerbate the situation, it was eventually confirmed that I had been correct all along, and the staff member’s actions were unjustified.Moreover, Lucy’s extremely accusatory tone and refusal to apologise for the confusion was very unwelcoming and loud in front of other customers, wrongly insisted that I had given an incorrect till number, which was not the case. I clearly stated the correct till number multiple times, yet the employee continued to argue with me in a highly unprofessional manner.When I enquired about the complaint procedure, Lucy was highly reluctant to give me any information. When I insisted, it was revealed that she was in fact not the manager of the store but the supervisor and had misled me. This dishonesty further compounded the poor experience and reflects a serious issue in staff integrity and customer service at your store.I expect a certain level of professionalism and courtesy from Asda and Esso staff, and this incident fell far short of those expectations. Such behavior is unacceptable and does not reflect well on your company’s reputation for customer service.I request a formal apology from the staff member involved and assurances that such an incident will not occur again. Additionally, I would appreciate an explanation of the steps Asda and Esso will take to prevent similar occurrences in the future.Date of experience: July 27, 2024",1

983,Asda,A Person,GB,"Jul 21, 2024","I have a few issues with AsdaI have a few issues with Asda: The clothes - tops are too short and the fits are awful. Till/Self check out - sick to death of going in a store and you have one person on a till and a queue a mile long, but loads of people stood at self serve watching you like you’re a criminalWine - priced at 14:50 in store yet £18:00 on the receipt!!Scarf - priced at £5 in the sale, still went through as original £10 pricePre-cooked chicken - awful, it used to be good not anymoreSecurity tags - walked out and beeped, security woman came to check, she said oh it’s the tag they should be deactivated, I said why had it not happened, it’s embarrassing having alarms going off, she asked if I was self checkout (again felt like a thief) even an older gentleman stepped in to say it has happened to him more than once and it was embarrassing also and she was quite simply the rudest woman I have ever had the misfortune to meet. Wouldn’t listen, I said that as a customer that’s my opinion and it should be noted as an issue, couldn’t get anywere as she knew EVERYTHING Won’t be going back it’s just a corner cutting exercise that’s gone wrong, bad meat, no staff, rubbish clothes and security guards who talk to you like a child.Date of experience: July 21, 2024",1

They make it hard to contact them , they recently delivered something from George which was smashed then asked me to review it but wouldn’t publish my review saying the goods were smashed.

Once again today I had an online grocery order delivered and handed 2 unsuitable substitution items back to the driver, totalling £24.They once again have failed to refund these though and marked the delivery as made. This has happened so many times and I have has to request refunds so many times that my account is now flagged to automatically reject every single refund request.Customer service just repeat the script that I have to hand things back to the driver but that is what I am doing!!!I even recorded one delivery as it was made and sent the video clip as proof.

After entering deep down you have to ask how to enter the market. I experienced the same and upon asking the answering staff was spot cold faced. I had to go out again and then to enter through the new entrance. I felt better to go to some other store.

As an elderly, infirm lady I walk to shop to buy this product.  When I got there I was told that it was £4.40.  Told each Asda store has different pricings.  Then why put this price up if it is not available at that price.  Or she said it is online order price.  This was not mentioned on the site.  Absolute crap.  This is just to get you in store.

Unfortunately I didn't realise until I got home which is ten miles away. No point going back. I bought two packs of  trek bars because they were on offer and obviously the tills haven't been adjusted as they charged me full price. This is a continual problem with their offers. Just not worth shopping there.Date of experience: July 19, 2024",1
994,Asda,Keith C,GB,"Jul 20, 2024","Good grocery deliveriesWe started with Asda during the lock down. They were the only delivery service that performed reliably. Staying loyal to them we have continued to use them in a weekly basis. Only once in three years did they fail and that was due to all roads being gridlocked to snow. Easy to get refunds if the product does not meet expectations. Very good company. Recommend them. Date of experience: July 17, 2024",4
